"Scroll Simple. Smart. Living. futteralhaus: simple. smart. living. Futteralhaus brings you simple smart living on a self-sufficient platform. We are redefining the real estate landscape with our vision of flexible smart homes that remain connected even in off-grid locations. Our mission is simple: to empower quality living independent of fixed concrete spaces. Using a combination of minimalist design, innovative smart technologies and natural building materials, a futteralhaus is the ultimate gateway to living on your own terms. We are bringing your dreams to reality. Join our simple smart living revolution. Our Story The first futteralhaus was designed and built in 2011 to fulfill a personal need when Maxim Kurennoy and his wife had their first child. Frustrated with inflated property prices and the challenges in finding the right property and location, Maxim decided to pre-build a tiny house on his own and transport it to a rural spot of their choice. Being an architect by profession and a minimalist by nature, Maxim has always been passionate about maximising space and making the most of compact living . It wasn t long before Maxim s friends started asking him to build these tiny houses for them. He realised that it was the perfect solution for many others like him. With futteralhaus, we are on a mission to strip away the mind-boggling complexities involved in buying a house. We want to make it as simple as placing an order on Amazon . But most importantly, we are revolutionising simple smart living. THE CONCEPT We are becoming more mobile, flexible and independent with each passing day. We re no longer confined to living in fixed concrete spaces. With futteralhaus, you can choose to live simply but comfortably, on a rooftop with a bird s eye view of the city, or at a remote spot surrounded by nature, while staying connected to the rest of the world. STRESS-FREE Our houses are designed to minimise stress. A smaller space means less junk and clutter, minimal maintenance and fewer distractions, giving you more time for what matters most to you. Our smart home ensures that the house runs on autopilot so you can spend more time with your family, focus on those creative projects, and reconnect with nature. NATURAL & SUSTAINABLE We use only natural construction materials that meet environmental standards. Examples include wood fibre insulation materials by Steico, which meets the ISO 14025 and EN 15804 standards. Besides that, our smart technologies keep the houses energy efficient and sustainable for minimal carbon footprint. SELF-SUFFICIENT A futteralhaus is designed to be completely self-sufficient. Besides a rainwater harvesting system for your sanitation and cooking needs, the house also features a Photovoltaic system that generates solar energy. FLEXIBLE AESTHETICS Ranging in size from 25 to 100m2, our tiny houses are designed for ultimate flexibility. Elegant yet functional, a futteralhaus comes with plenty of hidden storage for comfortable compact living. Its clean layout and tasteful aesthetics create a cozy and down-to-earth ambiance that s as inviting as it is soothing. WIN-WIN BUSINESS MODEL Using a business model that benefits both parties, we are selling our houses below the average market price. Our primary source of revenue will come from a commission on all income generated by the add-on services (futteralGR D & futteralC NNECT). When the homeowner makes money from selling their energy or renting out their homes, we will receive a certain commission from each transaction. In the long-run, this encourages more people to join our simple smart living revolution, allowing futteralhaus to grow together with the community. MOBILE Easily transported and installed at urban or remote locations of your choice, a futteralhaus is ideal for professional nomads looking for mobility and minimalist living.

Our Mission Our mission is to meaningfully reduce misdiagnosis and healthcare costs by making artificial intelligence intrinsic to the diagnostic process for time-sensitive and life-threatening conditions. When we re successful, we ll have elevated the global standard of acute medical care by providing universal future access to an expert-level diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic pathway through a comprehensive, seamless, secure, and trusted patient-level platform.

"contact@hilyte-power.com Facebook Twitter Google RSS Facebook Twitter Google RSS HOME PROBLEMATIC THE IRON BATTERY NEWS Press Videos Other TEAM CONTACT Select Page hiLyte Let s Bring Clean and Affordable Energy to All ! Keep in touch! hiLyte is a Swiss-based startup that aims at providing cheap clean energy for people who still use kerosene for lighting. The hiLyte solutions produce enough power to both charge a phone and give light to a room for one night. While the R&D team is working from Neuch tel, a Tanzanian branch was created to produce and distribute locally. This enables the team to build a product that fits completely to the end-users. In 2020, two different technologies are being tested to achieve our goal of enabling all people to get clean light and charge their phone at home. One of them uses the iron battery technology while the other is a wise mix of solar and electronics, but both of them emphasize on decentralization and empowering the rural people. Iron battery. Solar startup. Social entrepreneurship. greentech. cleantech CLEAN While the climate temperature is always rising, there is a huge need for solutions that reduce significantly the CO2 emissions but still enable people to fulfill their basic needs hiLyte is working on solutions using new and existing technologies that reduce at least 90% of the CO2 emissions. LOW-COST The people living in rural Africa can spend up to 30% of their income for light and phone charging. It has to change. The poorest people are the ones who pay the most for electricity. hiLyte works on solutions that target the poorest of the people. Everyone should have light and be able to charge their phone. LOCAL For many years, Western countries have brought to them a lot of wealth from Sub-Saharan Africa. Nowadays, companies and NGOs want to give them back by giving for free items that will help people getting a better life. We believe the best way to help people is to educate them , work with them , and give them confidence so that they can create by themselves. For this, we train Tanzanian people to be autonomous, and we manufacture our devices directly in Tanzania.

Innovative. Reliable. Engineers for building technology Heating Ventilation Air conditioning HVAC heat engine Wolfwil Ingenieurb ro Energy technology Planning Engineers for building technology with passion - So that you feel comfortable, even in adverse conditions. Heat-engine GmbH was founded in 2018 by Martin Mordasini in Wolfwil. Engineers for building technology with a holistic view of today's technical possibilities. But one thing should not be forgotten: the most important thing in the building is comfort. To make us feel comfortable, the temperatures and air quality must be right, and fresh water must be available at all times. But our ecological footprint is also becoming increasingly important. It doesn't matter to us whether it is a simple or highly complex system. We have the same standards of efficiency, economy and ease of use for every system. The focus at the beginning is on the basics. At the beginning, we pay particular attention to the creation of the necessary basics, for this we use, among other things, impulse advice or neutral energy advice, the building energy certificate GEAK but also thermal images (thermographs). Here it is like building a house: the building is not stable if the foundation is missing. Basics for energetic renovations (flyer) producing electricity and heat (checking solar potential) The joint consultation before and after ensures the necessary transparency and efficient achievement of goals. Here we can show you other options or alternatives and advise you on costs, quality and deadlines. We plan your project from A-Z according to your wishes and needs. Taking into account current and upcoming legislation and guidelines. Our sphere of activity encompasses the complete range of building services from: heating, ventilation, air conditioning, cooling, plumbing to photovoltaic systems and complex combined heat and power systems (CHP) such as CHP, ORC and many more. Protection of existing funds. As engineers for building technology, we are your trustee. It is our job to use the funds budgeted and made available to you in an efficient and targeted manner . Good preparation helps here, too, to only tackle where it makes sense and brings something. A profitability assessment helps to keep not only the investment but also the long-term costs under control. Because the costs during the actual usage phase are many times higher than the investment. Additional investments in construction are particularly useful if they reduce them . heat-engine planning building engineering engineer ro heating hlk building energy certificate geak energy advice w thermal images thermography hlks team wolfwil solothurn projects partner office company consulting energy building engineer partner systems impulse consulting heating replacement energy technology home technology heating system change woga w thermal imaging campaign winter special gas heating ban heat pumps pellets pellet heating air water geothermal probes solar thermal pv photovoltaic photovoltaic bhkw district heating local heating district cooling substations small power station orc storage wood chips firing controlled residential ventilation living space ventilation specialist construction management advice optimization technology building technical engineering energy fire protection customer jobs commercial engineering technical fire protection jobs jobs work optimal homepage heat engine planning building technology wolfwil solothurn projects partner office team company consulting energy building engineer hlks qualified services services home systems info search website engineer ro hlk impulse advice heating replacement energy technology house technology heating system change woga heat image campaign winter action welcome community contact map tel wolfwiler woufu fossil oil heating gas heating ban w heat pumps pellets pellet heating air water earth probes solar thermal pv photovoltaics remote small power plant orc storage wood chips firing controlled residential ventilation residential ventilation specialist construction management advice optimization technology building technical information occupation jobs www stand h rkingen roggwil langenthal oensingen olten egerkingen murgenthal rothrist zofingen oftringen projects services services energy projects fire protection bern renovation engineering in roaming engineering heating engineering r climatic cold thermal coupling photovoltaic planning office hlk planning hlks heat-engine wolfwil h rkingen egerkingen s olothurn basel bern aargau thal gu olten biel luzern sursee murgenthal langenthal building energy certificate geak plus energy advice energy consultant thermal images thermography construction building physics projects partner team office company consulting energy building building services home facilities services info search website facilities web site engineering replacement ro star consulting services house technology woga heating system change warm picture campaign winter action welcome ge meinde map tel wolfwiler woufu fossil oil heating gas heating ban heat pumps pellets pellet heating air water geothermal probes solar thermal pv photovoltaic photovoltaic bhkw district heating local heating district cooling substations small power station orc storage wood chips firing controlled housing ventilation living space ventilation job optimization technical engineering advice h rkingen roggwil langenthal oensingen olten egerkingen murgenthal rothrist zofingen oftringen energy fire protection bern fire protection bern fire protection bern renovation concepts aargau warmly qualified renewable energy planning building technology to rich customer news work optimal homepage engineers for building technology heat-engine Wolfwil H rkingen impulse consulting energy consulting building GEAK energy building rmebilder planning heating ventilation air thermal image campaign energetic renovation heating replacement engineering office building technology photovoltaic Mordasini building energy certificate GEAK building Energy certificate GEAK thermal images (thermography) Comparison thermal image normal image Address heat-engine GmbH Engineers for building technology Vordere Gasse 18 CH-4628 Wolfwil Contact Tel: +41 62 926 10 00 E-Mail: info@heat-engine.ch Gemeinde / Associations Community Wolfwil Commercial Association Wolfwil SME & Business G u Suissetec Switzerland shkt Partner Furrer Werbetechnik GmbH GF Marketing GmbH Kurti Bodendesign GmbH ST Schrmann Treuhand AG Tousure Vers.-broker AG 2020 heat-engine GmbH - Enfold Theme by Kriesi Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn Xing Imprint Privacy Policy Scroll to top This page uses cookies.

"Home Games News Blog Team Support Join Us WE MAKE MOBILE GAMES About Futureplay We're a bunch of free-spirited individuals who get our kicks out of creating great mobile games loved by players the world over. Our commitment is to make the right games at the right time. We've successfully launched five to date - and there are plenty more to come. VIEW OUR GAMES Here's what we stand for ""I've failed over and over again, and that's why I succeed."" -Michael Jordan Ownership and autonomy At Futureplay, our teams and our people are 100% autonomous and free to do their thing as top-notch developers. That means we re flat, lean, and streamlined, committed to protecting ourselves from hellish corporate structures like middle management. We each own a piece of the company, and every day we put our heart and soul into making Futureplay that little bit better, with an unrelenting focus on results over processes and taking action. In short? We get shit done. ""A great warrior is also a scholar, and a poet, and an artist"" -Steven Seagal Respect and trust Why build a team of smart people only to tell them what to do? At Futureplay, we trust each other to make the right decisions for ourselves and for our company, free from the shackles of micromanagement, excess bureaucracy and strict budgets. And that extends to work-life balance, too. We know there s more to life than work, and that s why it s up to you whether you work late or leave early. It s the results that matter, and it's more fun that way. ""I was born to make mistakes, not to fake perfection"" -DRAKE Openness and transparency At Futureplay, we fail fast, learn quickly, pick up the pieces and move on. And when that happens, we tell others about it, so they can learn too. What's the shame in that? We pride ourselves on being accountable for our actions - it means we can build an inclusive, safe space where we can be creative without fear of judgement. In a flat organisation like ours we re all responsible for helping one another succeed. And it ll always be that way. Latest news Get your employer to cut the bullshit.

"Search for: Digital Analytics Platform Our Team Board of Advisors clinical publications contact us Digital Analytics Platform Our Team Board of Advisors clinical publications contact us Data-Driven Solutions for Neurodegenerative Diseases at Your Fingertips. Digital Analytics Platform We know patients aren t diagnosed soon enough, they don t know how the disease is progressing. Artificial Intelligence nQ Medical s artificial intelligence-powered computational biomarker yields powerful insights. We believe that the way our fingers interact with computers can reveal the presence of certain neuromotor and neurocognition diseases like Parkinson s, Alzheimer s, ALS, and Multiple Sclerosis. Proven Through Trials The potential of our technology has been shown in clinical research at MIT, backed by the Michael J. Fox Foundation. We also have ongoing studies with the Cleveland Clinic and Massachusetts General Hospital to explore additional diseases. Real World Data The fine control of typing and touch screen kinematics, as well as the frequent use of personal devices like smart phones brings real world data to clinicians. Challenge Met By Machine Learning nQ uses machine learning to evaluate information obtained from the daily use of mechanical and touchscreen devices. Four clinical studies have demonstrated our ability to detect the pathological signs of neurological disease sooner than the tools we have today. Beyond the potential for early detection of symptoms, our AI technology supports clinical trials by improving accuracy and efficiency in recruitment, 24/7, passive monitoring of disease progression from home, and measuring the impact of therapy on outcomes at a far more granular level than current gold standards. What s more, our platform provides unified data management across the entire lifecycle, from clinical trials to clinician dashboards, and from patient engagement to population health. Key Uses of nQ s Patented AI Technology Recruitment and Support for Clinical Trials nQ addresses the real challenges faced by clinical trials head on. Specifically, it helps with: Remote, online recruitment of study participants by improving patient targeting and screening, thereby shrinking recruitment time. Dependence on in-clinic observation is reduced by relying on at-home, unbiased real-world data. Offers the potential to shape clinical trial design for neurodegenerative diseases with the earliest measure of therapeutic impact, thanks to passive, continuous monitoring of patients. Exploratory Development of Future Applications to Measure Disease Progression Future clinical applications in development include: A mobile app used to monitor patient care remotely under the guidance of a healthcare professional in conjunction with other prescribed therapy. A digital health device that supports clinical titration decisions, and a tool for patient engagement and adherence as well as caregiver observation. What Specialists Think In a recent survey 1 of 2,305 movement disorder specialists, 95% of respondents indicated that the ability to monitor patients remotely is extremely valuable, very valuable or valuable. Of current methods for the detection and monitoring of Parkinson s Disease that are most in need of improvement, they single out: The specificity and sensitivity of collected data for critical decision making (76%) The lack of access to real-world, at home, patient data (56%) The subjective nature of data collecting (55%) Furthermore, specialists feel that the availability of remote monitoring and disease progression data, like nQ provides, could potentially positively impact patient care by: Helping more accurately titrate medication (72%) Providing useful data to support treatment decisions (71%) Encouraging patients to become more involved in therapy (63%) Improving patient adherence to medication (53%) Assisting patients and caregivers better understand and manage the disease (50%) The specialists have spoken, and we are on the same page. 1.

This study showed that using nQ to monitor typing, a habitual behavior facilitated by the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, could allow for objectively and non-obtrusively monitoring Parkinsonian features and response to medication in an at home setting. Read the paper here . Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2018 This publication is on the value of nQ as a remote monitoring tool for Parkinson s. The paper compares nQ s performance in-clinic and at-home and showed that it provides similar quality measurements as a traditional in-clinic evaluation. Read the paper here . IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2017 In this study nQ presented our first result from the analysis of data gathered using smartphones. We showed that we can accurately discriminate an early PD population with mild Parkinsonian signs from a healthy control group by comparing the typing patterns from their interaction with touchscreen keyboards. Read the paper here . Scientific Reports, 2016 In nQ s first study focused on Parkinson s Disease, we showed data indicating that the routine interaction with computer keyboards can be used to detect motor signs in the early stages of Parkinson s. We presented a solution that relies on keystroke data from daily use of personal computers and converts it into a PD motor index. Read the paper here . Scientific Reports, 2015 In this proof of concept study, nQ demonstrated that daily interaction with a computer keyboard can be employed as means to observe and potentially quantify psychomotor impairment. This initial work in sleep inertia demonstrates that clinically relevant motor function changes can be measured by timing key press/release events from a typing routine on a physical keyboard, irrespective of the language or the typed text.

"What We Do About Us Team Partnering Media Careers - WE ARE HIRING Copyright 2020 Engine Biosciences Pte. Ltd. All rights reserved. design by otaviosantiago.com Deciphering Biological Complexity to Unlock Drug Discovery Engine Biosciences Raises $10 Million in Seed Financing to Accelerate Drug Discovery Using High-Throughput Gene Editing and Machine Learning Engine Biosciences Raises $10 Million in Seed Financing to Accelerate Drug Discovery Using High-Throughput Gene Editing and Machine Learning Our Awards Emerging Enterprise Award, Most Innovative 2018 Pfizer Golden Ticket Award 2018 T-Up Excellence Award 2019 A whole new kind of drug development platform. Endpoints News Drug Discovery s Complexity Problem Recent scientific and clinical advances have revealed that many of the most debilitating diseases, from cancer to neurodegenerative disorders, result from malfunctions in multiple genes and pathways. Traditional approaches to drug discovery which rely on serial trial-and-error testing of individual therapies or targets are too slow and costly to test and map the huge number of genetic interactions that underlie these diseases. Our Mission We're on a mission to unleash faster and more effective drug discovery. Led by experts in the fields of computational and synthetic biology and drug discovery, we are pioneering network biomedicine - combining high-throughput, massively parallel biological experimentation with high-throughput computation to empower better drug development and medicine. Faced with these problems, our team asked a few questions: What if instead of serial experimentation ( one by one ), we could do massively parallel experimentation ( all at once )? What if we had rich datasets on genetic interactions in specific biological (e.g. disease) contexts? What if we could use these datasets to build cellular maps , which could be probed to build a predictive engine for drug discovery? Our Approach Our Novel Network Biomedicine Platform Our proprietary and patented technologies bring speed, scalability, and cost advantages to the R&D process. Our high-throughput biological experimentation technologies reduce the exponentially scaling problem of deciphering biological networks into a linearly scaling one. Our tools for proprietary data generation and artificial intelligence approaches are building a more effective predictive engine for drug discovery and medicine. Our technologies can be applied across cell types and disease indications , meaning we can extend our impact to touch millions of lives worldwide. What We Do Accelerating drug discovery: Engine has developed an extensively validated platform for drug discovery that provides orders-of-magnitude gains in speed, scalability, and cost. Developing a systematic, scalable network biomedicine platform: Engine s artificial intelligence and genetic perturbation platform allows researchers and drug developers to uncover the gene interactions and biological networks underlying diseases faster and more cost-effectively than conventionally, test therapies that specifically target these interactions, and make important analyses and predictions for precision medicine applications. Tackling a fundamental healthcare problem: We still don t understand the critical biological drivers for specific disease contexts, and this prevents us from creating targeted therapies for patients in need. Building a world-class team supported by top investors: Our scientific leadership team sits at the forefront of systems and synthetic biology, genome engineering, and data science. Collectively we have founded over ten technology and biotech companies which have achieved commercial success and technological breakthroughs, and we are passionate about applying our entrepreneurial experiences to our mission at Engine. Our investors represent some of the world s leading investors and domain experts in biotech and deep tech.

"Home Contact Careers More We believe tech should make things better - not worse Since technology got involved, advertising has become a black box: non-transparent, frauded, and unfair. It is our mission to open this box, creating a world where everyone can benefit from what tech has to offer digital marketing and the programmatic ecosystem. Our products Our Founding Simplaex was founded by Jeff van Ede and Moti Tal in 2009. They gathered a team of talented engineers, data scientists and AI experts from prestigious tech companies such as Sony, Fyber, Smart, Inneractive, Fiksu and PayPal. And together they set out to develop clean-tech for the advertising industry . User acquisition, web and mobile, Advance perfected how, when and where ads are served to the audience that is most relevant to the advertiser s objectives. In-app retargeting. Engage helps marketers retain users by understanding their preferences and behaviour. The platform couples real-time audience insights and AI-driven predictive bidding to deliver the highest Return On Advertising Spend. The Journey Following a seed-round in 2015 and a series-A in late 2016 by Target Partners, High-tech Gr nderfonds and a private investor, Simplaex firmly established itself as a credible partner for Advertisers across the globe.The business grew exponentially, yet Simplaex struggled - similar to others in the industry - with the inefficiency and lack of transparency in the programmatic realm. It had become clear that the ecosystem as a whole was not on a path to reach its full potential.We decided that unless all players - publishers, advertisers and the consumer - can win nothing will change. So we went back to the drawing board and started working on RIVR. Simplaex today In 2018, Simplaex raised new capital to develop a whole new proposition: RIVR. RIVR is a propriety AI-powered targeting technology that brings together how both the demand and supply side understand their users. This solves the programmatic fragmentation and inconsistency of user information without adding another layer to the tech stack. In 2019 Simplaex sold our Engage product to one of our biggest clients to focus on what we see as the future of the company: OGNO and RIVR RIVR is an audience yield manager that helps Publishers and SSPs get more out of their bidstream. By integrating with header bidding, RIVR allows for real-time floor price optimization and demand partner selection. RIVR leverages information already available from traffic to increase revenue.

Felix Beatty, CISO Fintech Read the Case Study Nightfall integrates directly with all your SaaS, APIs, and data infrastructure. View More I've been in the security industry for a while and was looking for a strong, automated solution for data discovery, classification, and protection. I was very impressed with the accuracy of the classification on my unstructured data nothing on the market comes close to this. Shahar Ben Hador CIO, Exabeam Nightfall saves us substantial time and is more effective than doing this manually... We need this capability and I m grateful that Nightfall does such a good job. It is better than I expected and I typically have expectations that are high. CISO Fortune 100 Insurer We needed a DLP solution for our messaging platform. We needed a way to provide guardrails for our user community while remaining in compliance with our security policies. By far our favorite feature is the ease of usability. From download to install to initial configuration was maybe 15 minutes. Nightfall has enabled us to achieve compliance with our security program. We are a small organization that has limited resources and we have to rely on technology to do the job of humans. Dave Overfelt CISO, Plansight To ensure I had the proper context to reduce risk at our company, I needed a solution that was cloud first and able to provide visibility into my SaaS providers & infrastructure without slowing down the business. There were plenty of proxy solutions out on the market but none that were able to provide the same visibility and frictionless experience for our team members, enabling us to combat data spray and classification issues. That was until we started leveraging Nightfall their API-driven solution accurately monitored and was able to take immediate action, which was a game changer for us. CISO Hyper-Growth Tech Company We were looking for a product that quickly identified sensitive data, eradicated this data, and educated our users. Nightfall does this with a very low overhead. Our favorite feature by far are the workflows, having the ability to customize our notifications and data types makes this solution very versatile. Nightfall has helped our business enforce our security policies with very little effort. The level of support we have received, and flexibility has really impressed us.

Disguised as a BMS. PassiveLogic starts with the fundamental requirement a control system and embeds a complete Autonomous Platform for Buildings. It's like having a superhero on every project. Built on a digital twin foundation, PassiveLogic installation requires 90% less effort than a conventional Building Management System (BMS) yet provides a whole value-chain of solutions not previously possible. Real intelligence, real insight, and really simple all right at the ""edge inside of your building not just a cloud bolt-on to conventional dumb controls. Fully Autonomous. (Truly) Intelligent. Today's ""smart buildings"" aren't smart at all just connected. Expensive cloud add-ons that promise to ""un-dumb"" your control system can only provide low-value results and reduced reliability, all at the cost of more integration effort. No thanks. PassiveLogic's platform is the first truly intelligent building system. We automate automation, providing a fully autonomous BMS that controls your building based on the laws of physics, not arbitrary set-points or linear controls. No internet connection required. Designed for Everyone. Built for Installers. PassiveLogic solves your building challenges whether you are an owner, operator, architect, engineer, contractor, or ESCO all while making the installer's job downright fun. Everybody wins. At PassiveLogic we reimagined every aspect of automation, making your projects simple, fast, and error free at a price comparable to old-school thermostatics . PassiveLogic s affordable plug-and-play platform puts automation in reach of every building. AutoPilot eliminates manual programming and commissioning, saving hundreds of man-hours on every project. Every Building. Every Stakeholder. New construction or retrofit, PassiveLogic starts under a $1,500 price point and scales to the largest of projects. Whether your building project requires a sensor network, an analytics upgrade, a digital worksite process, or an energy retrofit PassiveLogic provides a complete Autonomous Building Platform at the price of a point solution, with a fraction of the effort. Built on Digital Twins. From the Ground Up. Draw, don't code. PassiveLogic's revolutionary building platform has a digital twin foundation bringing physics knowledge to your building workflow, and intelligence to automation. Our digital twin technology understands the underlying physics and interconnections between buildings, equipment, systems, and occupant physiology. With the power to understand buildings, PassiveLogic automatically introspects its own operation, continuously commissions for the best efficiency, and generates its own analysis. Shockingly, conventional automation systems know nothing about buildings. PassiveLogic changes the game, delivering optimal control based on laws of physics, not just on old-fashioned programmatic sequences. Future Forward Control. Thinks First. Then Acts. Introducing the first real revolution in automation in over a 100 years: future-forward control. Think of it like a time-machine for your automation system. Each control sequence is intelligently generated in real-time based on changing building dynamics. No more static sequences or manual coded assumptions just objectively better control. PassiveLogic's decision engine analyzes the future implications of every control action before applying it. Using an incredibly fast on-board physics engine, PassiveLogic analyzes millions of sequences futures every second selecting only the most optimal control given the current conditions. Automatically Optimized. Human-Centric Buildings. Buildings are designed for people. Now your control system is too. PassiveLogic is the first control system that understands human comfort. Our platform uses physiological digital twins to evaluate how we experience our environment. PassiveLogic uses control paths based on actual comfort, not just air temperature which is only 20% of the information needed to define comfort . No more arbitrary thermostatic set-points. No more fights between maintenance and occupants. Better comfort, better efficiency, better control. Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The Future is Now Digital Twins redefine the next 100 years of automation Quit living in the past. Most BMS systems are packaged to look modern, but under the hood they are the same old 19th-century thermostatics or 1930 s style proportional control systems and procedural programming. Impossible to tune, and never optimized. PassiveLogic changes the game.

CONTINUE SHOPPING DISCOVER THE AMX The ebike for cities Preorder now! As seen on It's a bike, with a motor The simplicity of single speed with the ease of electric. Learn more Discover the AM1 TWO FRAME STYLES AM1 CLASSIC Classic frame design Sport saddle Straight handlebar Focussed riding position AM1 STEP Step-through frame design Sprung saddle Curved handlebar Upright riding position Simple The AM1 looks like a single speed bike, but with an electric motor. Want to go faster? Turn up the assist. Want to get your heart rate up? Turn the assist down and ride it like a normal bike. Ultralight The AM1 makes moving effortless both on and off the bike. The average electric bike weights ~20kg+ while the AM1 weights just 13.5kg, that's the same as a non-electric bike! Powerful The motor boosts 4x more than the average human, it's like cycling downhill, uphill. The intelligent sensors respond to your motion, pedal slower to slow down and faster to speed up. Reviews THE HIGHEST RATED EBIKE Great Bike Just What I was Looking For. I would normally go for Form over Function but this bike has both. It looks awesome and rides like a dream. Quick acceleration and great manoeuvrability. Totally stripped down cool!!!!! Easy to assemble too!!! Jerry T. 11/19/2019 AM1 Bike that does its job and gives you freedom 1. Assambly Assambly is really not that complex as it may seem thanks to detailed instructions. Two areas where you may consider watching extra videos on youtube: a) brakes set-up, b) rear wheel alignment 2. Fun My travel time to work reduced from 30 to 20 min (I used non e bike before). Moreover I got freedom to choose: if i want my legs to work, i switch off motor, the bike is still great just as normal bike! I can easily go 25 km/h without motor. If I want to get to work extra fast or I'm lazy - I switch on the motor. My first battery charge lasted for 50km of ride. Aleksandr S. 11/12/2019 AM1+ Great experience from A to Z I ordered an AM1 and everything went perfectly well. I got quick answers to my questions on the chat when ordering and delivery in less than a week in France. Although I am not very good for DIY, putting the bike parts together was not too complicated and a great way to understand how the bike is built for ongoing maintenance . The bike is great to ride with a great design. I recommend analog motion 100% Emmanuel J. 11/10/2019 AM1 AM1 + Step City Bike rides in Munich Pleased with my AM1+ Step Bike. I recommend it already to a friend. She ordered the AMX Step Limited Edition. I could already order a battery with more power (24V, 7AH) with discount. A perfect city bike for Munich. Model looks like classic british bike, not screaming I am an E-bike. Ullrich N. 10/13/2019 AM1 STEP+ Brilliant electric bike I bought the Analog Motion Step bike as part of a cycle to work scheme. As an older person I was finding it difficult to keep cycling and this has given me the impetus to keep going. While it assists, it is still good exercise. It's a lovely bike to ride. My only comment would be to make sure you put your hand on the brake when stationary as the throttle can automatically surge if you move the pedals. Very light weight and looks like an ordinary bike so doesn't look conspicuous! Love it and the guys at Analog Motion are really helpful. Carolyn G. 10/02/2019 AM1 STEP Spectacular bike! A beautiful, well crafted bicycle, that is easy to ride, maintain and looks great, oh, and is electric! Unlike most bikes in this genre, the AM1 doesn t look electric and doesn't let the practicalities of motors, etc, get in the way of style :) Love it, have already ordered another! Stephen M. 09/26/2019 AM1 STEP+ Great Bike Assembling the bike wasn't as easy as I expected - especially the brakes took me a couple of tries, until I was really certain. But now that I have the bike I am double as proud as I could be if I had bought it ready assembled from a shop. Using it every day since I bought it. :) Florian S. 09/23/2019 AM1 STEP+ AM1 + I have now been riding AM1 for about 150km. Bike is really fast and it has shortened my 8km commuting time from 25 minutes to roughly 19 minutes one way. Also I don't need to take a shower when i get to the office which was the main reason why i bought this bike in the first place. The bike looks amazing on pistachio green with black parts and fenders. Ride comfort is a bit tense so I am going to switch wider tires for next season. Overall I am happy with my bike and hopefully it will last for years to come. Jukka 09/23/2019 AM1+ Single speed viable in hilly city Having the electric boost makes owning a single speed viable in my hilly city. Cruising speed is about 30km/hr on the flat and not much less going up the hills . Battery life is better than expected so far with some basic power management as you ride (turn down the assist whenever it makes sense). Very happy with it! Josh 09/01/2019 AM1+ Exciting bike Top bike , 100 % different to all other boring e bikes Stefan H. 08/25/2019 AM1+ A great ride I'm truly impressed. No complaints at all. I love it! Sebastian 08/24/2019 AM1+ Love this bike! Adore my bike! Bought this to commute without the hassle of turning up sweat drenched. Quality is great and so is the range of the battery. Love it so much I tell everyone about it! Emma 08/23/2019 AM1 STEP+ Faster than I expected With my AM+ I ride 24km to work every day. That consumes about 50 - 70% of baterie depends of weather and traffic. Surprising is that I can get engine support up to 35km/h on level 5. Without support I can get up to 40km/h. I strongly recommend Adjustable Stem Pack for more comfortable ride position. Lukasz G. 08/22/2019 AM1+ More than I could have expected! The AM1 definitely makes a huge promise about it's functionality when you see it on the website.. and damn, I was not disappointed! The assembling was easy to manage by myself and after I got it a week ago, I was riding it every single day as much as possible! It's just a lot of fun to have the motor on and it makes biking in the city much faster, especially at traffic lights! Since I live in quite a hilly city, it's perfect to go uphill with less effort. But even with the motor turned off, it's super easy to ride it in flat areas. The design is wonderful and with the pistachio green it's an eye-catcher! Many thanks from Stuttgart to Nav & Jack for their wonderful work on this awesome bike! Connor 08/20/2019 AM1 Lightweight, stylish and easy to use My wife and I bought an AM1 + through Kickstarter. We are thrilled with the modern style, the low weight and the ease of use. The assembly was easy even for a layman to realize. Thilo M. 08/17/2019 AM1 STEP+ The right balance between minimalism and functionality I ordered two of these for my girlfriend and myself. Assembly was quite a bit more laborious than I imagined, but once that was done, the joy of the first rides quickly made us forget about that. These bikes are really quite surprising in a very positive way, and feel great to ride. In our case the range seems quite a bit wider than 30km, more like 45km. I guess this depends a lot on how flat the terrain is and how often one has to stop at red lights. We're very happy about our purchase. J rg L . 08/14/2019 AM1+ Lightweight design for urban cycling The lightweight design makes it fun to ride even without electric assistance. It s a beautiful bike. Christian S. 08/12/2019 AM1 STEP+ Great commuter Very good range and general feeling when riding the step+. I have been commuting with it for 5 months without a issues. Max 08/11/2019 AM1 STEP+ wonderful and a lot of fun Hi AM1-Team, I took a little time to assemble, but it was also a lot of fun, and now I know almost all the screws on the bike. My first impressions are very good, it is a lot of fun to be on the road. 55/5000 The wait was worth it, thank you and all the best. Stefan Stefan B. 08/01/2019 AM1+ Stylish bike with good quality Assembling the bike is not a big challenge for IKEA-experienced people. The descriptions are easy and very understandable. The quality of the bike parts appear to be very good and the first test were very positive. I can t wait to expand the testing during the next weeks. It seems to be a big success... Philipp K. 07/29/2019 AM1+ Smooth ride I only can recommend the bike running smoothly every day Thomas H. 07/29/2019 AM1+ Easy and cool I was looking for a pedelec that looks cool and it isn t too expensive which seemed like a contradiction. Luckily I found analog motion. The setup took an afternoon and it was really not to complicated. The bike kept all its promises. Next week I will try to install a thule chariot. PR 07/28/2019 AM1 STEP+ Wow Ebike It is a good thing, the speed, the weight and the look, thank you for this :-) G nter Kaiser G nter K. 07/25/2019 AM1+ Super Fahrrad Es macht unheimlich viel Spa mit dem am1+ durch die Gegend zu rasen. Ich schaffe auf Stufe 5/5 ber 20 km Reichweite. Jedes Mal wenn ich vom Rad absteige habe ich ein Riesen grinsen im Gesicht! Danke an das Team, die das m glich gemacht haben. Thanks to all the whole am Team! ***** It is a lot of fun with the am1 + racing through the area. I can do it at level 5/5 over 20 km range. Every time I get off the bike I have a big grin on my face! Thanks to the team that made that possible. Thanks to all the whole team! Fabian 07/22/2019 AM1+ first week Mein AM1 Step + f hrt sich gut, genau richtig f r die Stadt. Die Batterie l t sich schnell ausbauen und z. B. zum Einkauf gut mitnehmen. Die ersten Probefahrten im Freundeskreis haben bereits stattgefunden. Alle sind begeistert von der kompakten Form und dem f r e bikes geringen Gewicht . Danke an Jack und Nav, sie haben ein richtig gutes bike entwickelt! Peter *** My AM1 Step + runs well, just right for the city. The battery can be removed quickly and z. B. good for shopping. The first test rides in the circle of friends have already taken place. Everyone is enthusiastic about the compact shape and the low weight for e bikes. Thanks to Jack and Nav, they have developed a really good bike! Peter Peter E. 07/18/2019 AM1 STEP+ Best ebike for sportive drivers Thanks so much for this design. I expected my AM1 would be good - but even in my landscape with 50m uphills it is so comfortable! The frame design is excellent. As an e-bike this is a must have for sportive bikers and I am sure, this bike is today a forecast how e-bikes will be designed much more future. Thanks a lot once again.

"Tenant Screening Overview Enterprise Pricing API Blog Help Sign In Sign Up Protecting your rental income starts with the right tenant. Naborly s free tenant screening service lets landlords confidently screen potential tenants, minimizing the risk of late rent payments, rent default and property damage. Start Screening How does it work? Our goal was to ensure that our technology is not only useful but accessible to everyone. In that spirit, we designed our application and screening system to work as seamlessly as possible with the existing application process landlords and tenants are familiar with. 1. Send an application to screen your tenants Naborly provides landlords with an online rental application form they can send to potential tenants. Tenants securely provide their employment, financial, and rental history information allowing Naborly to verify their identity, income and employment. 2. Receive and review the NaborlyReports As soon as the applicant clicks 'Submit' Naborly pulls credit, criminal records, and rental history records, then analyzes the applicant's risk profile. Within minutes the results are delivered for the landlord to review so you can make the right tenant decision, faster than ever. Create an Account Testimonials Find out what our customers are saying. Since filing the claim with NaborlyShield, I ve been very impressed with Naborly s response time and commitment to moving the claim forward Really appreciated as a landlord with a thousand things to do in a day, that this is one thing I don t have to harass anyone to get done. Jamie Buehler, Oak & Apple Property Management We are a moderate sized property management company in Windsor, Ontario. We have been utilizing Naborly reports in our tenant placement process. I would highly recommend the Naborly system to all landlords. We have had zero evictions, late rent payments and property damage done to our rental since the implementation of Naborly. This allows us to offer tremendous value to our landlords. Thank you Naborly for providing a high quality service that scales with enterprise users.. Colin Hart, Property Manager I love the service and I think its a fantastic tool for us to use as landlords. We will be long term customers. Dave Andersen, Landlord Naborly s technology is the clear leader in Tenant Screening, their infrastructure, their reports, and their customer service is unparalleled. It was easy to see that for us to deliver on our vision to build a great end-to-end property management platform we had to partner with Naborly. Philipp Postrohovsky, COO, RentMoola Naborly offers a truly unique service that allows prospective tenants to connect with landlords, creating a positive ecosystem that facilitates seamless consent-based exchange of data. This process helps people to find the right home faster and easier, while at the same time the landlord better understands the needs of those tenants. Chris Briggs, CMO, Equifax Canada This is an awesome service. You guys are taking the screening process to the next level. Thank you! Andrel Wisdom, Landlord The future of renting, powered by Naborly. Naborly has engineered and deployed the foundational infrastructure that powers modern landlords, property managers, and all major RentTech software platforms. AI Powered Data Gathering & Analysis Our Applied Artificial Intelligence system learns from and leverages the experience gained from screening thousands of rental applicants and their tenancy outcomes. This helps Naborly's analysts and customers see patterns of risk that could only can be detected by our AI. Accurate & Equitable Scores Unlike a credit score, Naborly's Scoring System adjusts based on each applicant's unique situation, the rental property's characteristics, and the state of the market. This allows Naborly to generate accurate analysis on nearly all applicants, while removing traditional factors of discrimination. Tenants and landlords can be assured that all Naborly algorithms are audited to meet and exceed Fair Housing and FCRA Compliance. Improved Record Keeping & Data Sharing Naborly's open_DOOR database system democratizes rental record keeping by allowing tenants, landlords, and property managers to share positive feedback, verified disputes, evictions, and judgements on an unified global database. By sharing more positive and negative information, both tenants and landlords have more transparency before entering into a contract. Bank-Grade Privacy & Security All customer data from Naborly's landlords, tenants, and API Partners are protected by state-of-the-art data security infrastructure and leading compliance controls to ensure that any information entrusted to Naborly is only accessible to authenticated, credentialed recipients and always with our customers express permission. Universal Digital Applications Our standardized digital application makes applying simple for tenants and landlords. Fully compliant across the US & Canada, it ensures that we're asking the most important questions and not infringing on Privacy or Fair Housing Laws. Universal Tenant Profiles When a tenant completes our online application their information is saved to their Private Tenant Profile or ""Renter's Resume"". This allows landlords to provide feedback and endorsements for the tenant who can use their profile to apply to future rentals with their verified rental history. This eliminated tedious printing, scanning, and faxing of documents, and the system even allows them to apply to landlords that don't use Naborly. Ready to get started?

The difference between designing a building or a facility well or poorly is very small, but over time this difference increases. We correct this difference or this azimuth so that the facilities and buildings are well designed, well rehabilitated, and well managed so that they can function for many years with less energy consumption and even improving their comfort. According to the dictionary you can write Azimuth or Azimuth, but the Arabic origin of this word is with H, we have retrieved it to conclude with the word Azimuth. Visi n ACIMUTH is an energy efficiency and renewable energy company that solves the problems of each client, based on extensive experience in the sector and all the technological tools available, offering the best solution for each need.

"Home Solutions Parcel, Pallet, Groupage Full Truck Load Container Shipping Lines Manufacturers with Logistics Assets Rail Cargo and Intermodal Rental and Leasing Freight Forwarding Customers About Us Company Team Customer Board Board of Directors Advisory Board News Our Conference Blog Careers Contacts Request A Demo Stop shipping air Transmetrics solution provides cargo companies with data cleansing, demand forecasting and predictive optimization based on data science and AI. Learn more What We Do Transmetrics is a predictive optimization company that helps cargo transport and logistics service providers increase their operational efficiency by applying modern technology such as artificial intelligence, data mining, predictive analytics and computer optimization. Transmetrics SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) is offered in three steps: data cleansing, demand forecasting, and predictive optimization. What We Offer Request A Demo 2013 Transmetrics was officially launched after receiving funding from LAUNCHub 24 Transmetrics has grown to a team of 24 highly-skilled professionals 1.2 billion + More than one billion of shipments have been analyzed, forecasted and optimized through Transmetrics Transmetrics in the Press Hear Directly From Our Customers ""Transmetrics talks the talk and walks the walk. When TIP Trailer Services consulted vendors to assess how predictive analytics could help optimize our fleet management and trailer pooling solutions, Transmetrics stood out as one of the very few that could actually deliver. Once engaged, we particularly appreciated their can-do attitude: they just kept powering through imperfect data, flawed processes and evolving requirements. Transmetrics is now a valued partner in our mission to increase fleet utilization and lower TCO for logistics and retail companies."" Yvan Giroud Product Manager TIP Trailer Services (HNA Group) ""The big advantage of Transmetrics over many data analytics companies is that they know a lot about logistics and continue to learn since they exclusively focus their knowledge on this one industry. This helps to build models that create tangible benefits. Transmetrics finds solutions to make data work in a generally bad-data environment instead of complaining about the lack of data or data quality. They have assembled a lot of creative thinkers who pragmatically clean data and make it usable and on the way creating unexpected benefits for our dispatchers and managers alike."" Nils Wemhoener Former Senior Vice President Operations Overland Kuehne + Nagel AG ""With the Transmetrics application, the benefits are very visible. Before using Transmetrics solution, the rate of fleet utilization was 72%. Currently, we have above 82% [utilization] and we are expecting this to increase. We estimate the total cost reduction at 7-9%, which is a great result for us."" Danail Danailov Board Member Speedy (DPDgroup) We had been looking for a partner who could help us streamline our empty container flows for a long time. There are different IT solutions on the market, but we chose Transmetrics over other providers because they proved their technical expertise and also demonstrated a deep knowledge of the logistics industry and container shipping in particular, which is very difficult to find. Carlo Zaalberg Global Director Logistics NileDutch ""In order to get high load factor, we need to forecast. Transmetrics is something we believe in, Big Data is something we believe in and it can add value to our business."" G.J. Global System & Data Manager Top 5 Global Logistics Company ""We are impressed by the improvements delivered by the Transmetrics platform, which were both immediate and quantifiable. Using Transmetrics reporting system, we can measure the efficiency of our fleet and set correct KPIs for our warehouse team. The implementation was easy and support from the Transmetrics team is always excellent."" Alex Petkov Director of Operations and Board Member DPD Romania ""By implementing Transmetrics product we hope to get a very detailed prediction of the demand for our transport fleet, which will allow us to reposition our assets to where they are most needed, cut the number of kilometers driven, and maximize the use of drivers time. We also hope to be able to know in advance how much extra capacity we need to book through the use of third-party fleets in times of need, in order to meet the peak demand.""

TIDAL ENERGY Transforming the power of our seas into clean predictable energy About Us Nova Innovation is a world-leading tidal energy company; transforming the power of our seas into clean, predictable electricity. We design, build and operate tidal turbines that generate electricity from the natural ebb and flow of the tide. Our underwater turbines have zero visual impact and work in harmony with the marine environment, with no barriers or barrages. Tidal energy is an abundant, predictable and clean source of energy. Our technology can be installed in deep water, shallow water, estuaries and large rivers; creating a global opportunity for this vast untapped market. In 2016, we installed the world s first offshore tidal array three turbines located in the Shetland Islands, Scotland. Our turbines have been generating clean electricity and exporting to the grid for over three years. In 2018, we worked with Tesla to add energy storage to our tidal technology. This created the world s first grid connected tidal power station with the ability to deliver baseload (constant, steady-state) power and deliver energy on demand to meet consumer needs.

The efficiencies gained with this software are impressive. Alex Membrillo, CEO at Cardinal We wanted to scale our sales process and Growbots turned out to be the best solution. Instead of hiring additional SDRs, we used the tool to generate more leads. The results were outstanding! We saw a 10x increase in the number of leads per week. Martin Garbarczyk, Co-founder at Relatable It was very important to us that Growbots, as a new source of leads to our sales pipeline, be integrated into our existing Salesforce data the team at Growbots helped us accomplish this!

Daniele Packard, Sales Engineer at Samasource Growbots also has a great Customer Success team that is always willing to go out of their way to help in any way they can.

"About Products Transparency Engine TraceDonate Portfolio Blog Contact Us We believe the most important commodity in the next 10 years will be your data. And you should decide how it works for you.

DID provides a standard for users to enjoy permanent, globally unique, cryptographically verifiable identifiers entirely under their control. No one can take it away from whoever owns or controls the associated private key. DID is a sea change in digital identity. Our products AID:Tech s products offer multifaceted benefits to organisations and end-users. With digital ID at the core, it acts as a reliable, flexible and secure gateway for add-on services.

We find the cause of the disease in the sequenced genome <0.1% Scope of traditional DNA test 99.9% MNM Diagnostics test A genome is a complete set of human DNA, comprising the sequence of more than 20 000 genes. Traditional genetic testing uses less than 0.1% of the information of our DNA, and focuses on identifying mutations in a handful of well-understood genes. The remaining 99.9% of the DNA contains useful diagnostic information, 
which is usually ignored by most testing services due to its complexity. Knowing the genetic origin of your cancer is the key to finding a proper solution The genomic profile of each person's tumour is unique. Detected changes may determine how your disease behaves and why it grows. Traditional antitumour drugs have not been adjusted to tackle specific changes in your cancer genome. New revolutionary approaches to fight cancer are based on clinicians recommending treatments relaying on knowledge about genomic profile of your tumour. We use the most advanced artificial intelligence technology for cancer diagnosis We're using advanced and innovative software tools for rapid and effective early disease diagnosis, prediction and prognosis. Using Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) platforms, we have developed proprietary algorithmic solutions to analyze genomic data to provide deep understanding of the cause of your disease.

"About Press Release Our Story Contact Product PhantomVision PhantomFusion PhantomDrive Technology Career Democratizing advanced driver assistance systems A modular, software-based vehicle stack that allows Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs to customize and configure for unparalleled flexibility PhantomVision TM 360 Vision PhantomVision TM is a scalable, flexible and reliable Deep Learning based computer vision solution that provides a comprehensive suite of Euro NCAP compliant ADAS features. It supports vehicle, pedestrian,
 bicyclist, free-space, traffic sign and traffic light detection. It is a visual perception engine that enables a single or multiple camera to autonomously recognize road objects and sophisticated traffic directions in
 the vicinity of its driving path. The multi-camera system covers a 360 degree view from the vehicle in an optimal combination of front, side, rear-view cameras and does not allow any blind spots. Gazing at a far-distant area
 from front and rear cameras increases the safety margin from dynamically and aggressively moving traffic. The real-time detection and target tracking on a bird-eye view provides an accurate motion estimate of road
 objects to various ADAS functions such as AEB (Auto Emergency Braking), ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control), TJA (Traffic Jam Assist) and LKAS (Lane Keeping Assist System). PhantomVision TM can be deployed on low power embedded SoCs (System on Chip) with leveraging our innovative deep learning and computer vision technology
 running on hardware accelerators. PhantomFusion TM Sensors PhantomFusion TM is a platform independent sensor fusion and object tracking system. The modular sensor fusion solution creates a thorough environmental model by fusing outputs from various sensors like
 camera, radar, LiDAR and ultrasonic. It generates the most accurate and clear detections in any scenes and guarantees detections in any partial sensor fail events by combining the strengths of each sensor with tracker.
 Regardless of vehicle type and sensor placement, PhantomFusion TM allows for faster integration of a perception system and more uniform tracking in the areas needed for various levels of autonomy. PhantomDrive TM ADAS Control PhantomDrive TM is a vehicle control solution that creates a safe and natural vehicle movement by predicting the motion of objects detected. Each function is available by sensor configuration and map
 availability. The system is scalable and can be applied to any level of automation. It understands road and traffic situation from perception output, screens out any false-positive information and compensates for any
 missing information by rational reasoning. The system assesses any collision risk against other objects and/or deviating risk from lane or road boundaries and decides appropriate functions based on risk assessment and
 ego-vehicle's status. By generating the future vehicle trajectory, it controls acceleration, braking and steering. It minimizes the probability of any kind of collision and handles any emergency situation caused by
 other object or by fail events. PhantomDrive TM enables features like Adaptive Cruise Control with cut-in vehicle handling, Automatic Lane Keeping and Automatic Lane Change. Industry s most advanced computer vision technology Camera Data Annotation Deep Learning Optimization Camera gain control Image capture with Best Camera Exposure Control for daytime and nighttime (Tunnel, Direct Sun etc.). Optimal Data & Data Augmentation Optimal data including all types of corner cases for Deep Learning and Novel data augmentation techniques to increase diversity of data Labeling Technique Best annotation policy gained from a unique experience with millions of data and hundreds of labelers Deep Learning & Post Processing Powerful Deep Learning detection pipeline with sophisticated tracking algorithms Code Optimization Real-Time processing of multiple cameras with state-of-the art Deep Learning models Press Release Phantom AI Raises $22 Million in Series A Funding to Democratize Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) for all Types of Vehicles.

Al Globus Editor-in-Chief National Space Society Award Force chose Copyleaks as a plagiarism checker for their contest software. We held a contest, the NSS Space Settlement Contest, and it only took four days to handle the problems exposed by over 2,700 entries from 13,000 kids. Copyleaks support for this effort was outstanding. Once Copyleaks worked in the Award Force world, we were able to use plagiarism detection effectively and it played a major role in the success of the contest David Senior Software Engineer Kobil Systems I've used Copyleaks while writing my master thesis and it has been an excellent experience.
Everything from signing up, payments and the actual literature comparison process worked as expected. Having an AI checker in addition to traditional text cross-referencing definitely helped me to feel more confident with the results and in the end, my thesis passed all reviews at the university. Copyleaks supports the important and usual file types and does a very good job in parsing PDF files, which, in my opinion, is the most important feature. In my case, I analyzed a PDF generated from LaTeX, and I was happy with the results. Sheza Writer Otrainings I like this software as it is quite easy to use. It helps me to detect any kind of plagiarism or similar words present in the document. It just takes a few minutes for checking a long text. As I am a writer, I found this site quite helpful for me. I can check mine as well as other people s content within no time. Priyadarshi Desai Entrepreneur in Residence Hello Health Group The best part of Copyleaks is that it helps me check English as well as my local language (Hindi). This is something that not every plagiarism tool does accurately due to difference in text type (Roman or Latin vs local script). The results are quite accurate and the report is useful to provide feedback to writers / content producers. Maria Hart Blogger Soaking Up Joy I love this software. I have used Copyleaks just a couple of times, but I love that I can easily search the web and see if any of the content I have written for my blog
has been copied and placed in unauthorized places. Michal Kucha SEO specialist SEOlight s.r.o. It is simple to use and includes an API. Support is always fast and helpful. We get an individual pricing plan for our needs, which is not standard for other software. Jacqueline Croswhite Teacher Intermountain Christian School This software does a great job of showing what material may be copied from other sources. It highlights the materials and shows what possible websites from which the material may have come. Security & Data Safety Your data s security and safety is our top priority.

"Home Try Engine Imandra Core Demo Gallery Docs Research Industries Financial Markets Autonomous Systems Machine Learning Media Media Blog Company About Careers We are hiring! Imandra is a cloud-native automated reasoning engine. Imandra's groundbreaking AI helps ensure the algorithms we rely
 on are safe, explainable and fair. Try Imandra Online Install Imandra locally News: Itiviti to expand AI capabilities with Imandra alliance 30 January 2020 Blog news: Analysing Machine Learning Models with Imandra 27 September 2019 Spotlight on an Imandra user: In 2017 Imandra Inc. partnered with Goldman Sachs to help deliver the SIGMA X MTF Auction Book, a new orderbook venue implementing periodic auctions. Imandra Inc. used Imandra, our own automated reasoning engine, to formally model the Goldman Sachs design of the SIGMA X MTF Auction Book, verify its key properties, and automate rigorous testing. Now that the venue is live, Imandra is being used to perform ongoing validations of trading operations. NEW Verified Autonomy Imandra has powerful techniques for reasoning about complex environments. They are inspired by Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) but are lifted to algorithms at large. We believe they will become one of the fundamental enabling technologies for the autonomous age. Check it out! Imandra is Reasoning as a Service Whether you're writing mission-critical code (who isn't today?) or
 need to understand the countless complex decisions that a system may make, Imandra brings the latest
 advances in automated reasoning to your fingertips. Imandra was designed at cloud-scale, so whether you're
 working on a school project or the next Mars rover - we've got you covered. See the details Imandra proudly supports ReasonML, OCaml and Python (IDF only). NEW Demo Gallery Check out our new Demo Gallery containing a sortable diverse collection of Imandra examples. Demo Gallery Formal verification Historically, formal verification was reserved to
 highly specialised teams of PhDs at places like NASA. Imandra is changing this with unprecedented automation and interfaces to
 ReasonML and OCaml. Imandra has many advanced features, including first-class computable
 counterexamples, symbolic model checking, support for polymorphic higher-order recursive functions,
 automated induction, state-space decompositions and more. Symbolic reasoning Algorithms are all around us. From legal contracts to system designs
 to corporate cap tables, we're constantly reasoning about what these algorithms can or cannot do. And when
 we can't keep up, bad things happen. Most real-world systems can be in a virtually infinite number of possible states. Imandra's deep
 symbolic reasoning can describe, analyse and explore these infinite state spaces, giving you unprecedented
 insight into what you're up against. NEW Python IDF Interface Check out the documentation and examples of our newly released Python interface to Iterative Decomposition Framework (IDF). Read more Imandra Reasoning Studio Great technology needs great UIs. Download
 our VS Code plugin here .
 Today you'll find the usual suspects - syntax highlighting, type checking, interactive docs, etc., with the
 Imandra REPL available for IDE integration. Soon you'll have asynchronous verification, machine-learning
 powered assistance and much more, all available within VS Code. Download VS Code plugin Imandra Reasoning Machines Need to add some reasoning to your product? Just use Imandra
 as an API! We're already working with a select group of companies on adding automated reasoning into their
 product lines. Soon, we'll open this up to the developer community at large. Email us at contact@imandra.ai if you have a great use case that will push our technology to the limit. NEW Article! Please check out our latest article: Constraint solving your UIs If software is eating the world, we really should take it more
 seriously. When the algorithms we rely on are unsafe, unfair or inexplicable, the results
 can be catastrophic. Imandra is powering a new generation of tools for the rigorous design, analysis and
 governance of complex algorithms. Verified Autonomy Read more Financial Markets Read more Machine Learning Read more > < Distributed Ledger Technology Distributed Ledger Technology shows promise in helping to fix
 some of the issues facing financial markets. However, as many high-profile costly DLT bugs have
 shown, the code running on such systems is very difficult to get right, and must be subjected to
 formal verification. In 2015, we pioneered the application of formal verification to DLT. In fact, we were the
 first to create a formal model of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, empowering Imandra to reason
 about the possible behaviours of Ethereum smart contracts. As new blockchain protocols and stacks
 are developed, Imandra is powering a new generation of tools helping to ensure the safety and
 correctness of these systems. Relevant links: Imandra Contracts White papers: Creating
 Safe and Fair Markets Robotics As robots become more ubiquitous and complex, we need to
 understand and stay in control of what they can and cannot do. We have created an Imandra
 interface to Robot OS ( www.ros.org ),
 allowing you to leverage an existing widely popular
 framework and write code that you can verify for safety and correctness properties. The
 Imandra-ROS package is open source and is available here . Relevant links: Imandra interface to Robot OS: Part I Imandra interface to Robot OS: Part II Simple vehicle controller Safety-critical industries From aerospace to railroads to self-driving cars, the systems we
 rely on most run on heavily regulated algorithms. Imandra's automated reasoning technology is
 changing how these industries create and regulate their algorithms by: 1. Providing an accessible and scalable methodology for writing and verifying specs and
 production-level code, and 2. Providing a scientifically sound methodology for requirements traceability, backed by
 Imandra's symbolic reasoning and state-space decompositions. Imandra can be easily plugged in as a reasoning backend into many safety-critical
 toolchains. Relevant links: Simple vehicle controller Ripple carry adder Hardware manufacturing Modern hardware designs are incredibly complex and leading
 designers already rely on formal verification to ensure key aspects of their correctness.
 Imandra's embedding in a high-performance programming language (OCaml), first-class support for
 computable counterexamples, seamless integration of symbolic model checking and automated and
 interactive theorem proving (including automated induction, lemma-based conditional rewriting and
 forward-chaining, decision procedures for nonlinear real arithmetic and more), make it an ideal
 framework for the most demanding hardware verification tasks. Relevant links: Ripple carry adder Government & regulators The effective regulation of algorithms is of paramount
 importance. The safety of shared infrastructure and protection of private information must be
 checked by governments and properly enforced. At Imandra, we continue to be vocal about the need for government
 regulators to leverage deep advances in automated reasoning for powerful and cost-effective
 algorithm governance. Relevant links: Comment for the proposed SEC Reg ATS-N Comment for Proposed Rule 80 FR 78824 (CFTC Reg AT) Comment for Investors' Exchange LLC (IEX) Form 1 Application Web development Bad things happen when hackers know more about your web
 application than you. With GDPR coming online in 2018, companies can face fines as much as 4% of
 their annual revenue. With Imandra, you can bring the most rigorous software development
 techniques to bear on web development. Imandra supports ReasonML, an OCaml language created by Facebook for web development.
 We re
 actively working on an interface to React, one of the most popular Javascript frameworks. Relevant links: Introducing Verified React Verifying ReasonReact component logic ReasonML & Imandra Probabilistic reasoning in ReasonML Education Historically, computer science departments have often had a
 separation between theory and practice. Often, the mathematics underlying program correctness is
 restricted to upper theory courses, far removed from programming practice. It's time we change
 that! Imandra bridges this gap, allowing you to teach logic and formal verification in a
 real-world
 language that your students can apply immediately in a real-world setting. Imandra's automation
 allows students to verify deep properties of their code (and crucially, obtain counterexamples to
 their often false conjectures) long before they understand predicate calculus or induction! Research The computational modelling of chemical, biological and physical
 systems is a foundation of modern science, with much analysis happening from a stochastic or
 continuous perspective. The phrasing of the evolution of a system as an ""algorithm"" is key. Automated reasoning can bring powerful new analyses to bear on such problems, especially
 when it comes to taming nontrivial discrete combinatorics of interactions. From drug discovery to
 CRN correctness, we'd love to help you apply Imandra to your deepest problems. Legal services Contractual agreements have a lot in common with algorithms. In
 fact, many contracts can be directly represented in a machine-reasonable way, making it possible
 to apply automated reasoning to understand their implications, edge-cases and potential exploits. Imandra's cloud-native automated reasoning APIs are the ideal foundation for building
 next-generation contract analysis tools. We'd love to help you get started!

Leave this field empty if you're human: Follow @Arborea_Food THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO FEED ALL THE WORLD WITH HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD BY MAKING IT THE PRIMARY CHOICE, NOT THE ALTERNATIVE! Julian P. Melchiorri, Founder and CEO ARBOREA MISSION We all love food, but while our population is growing, Earth s limited natural food resources are strained by climate change, leading to the current increase in global hunger, undernutrition and food prices. Our mission is to accelerate the global transition to sustainable food by producing the most sustainable and best healthy food ingredients through the most advanced organic cultivation system, driven by nature s power! The Start-up Trying to Save the World Arborea has engineered and patented techniques for solving cultivation problems A mission that has won high praise to Arborea This project has received funding from the European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 878259 BIOSOLAR LEAF Arborea s team developed the world s first BioSolar Leaf cultivation system which harnesses natural photosynthesis in a completely new way. Thanks to sunlight, our technology facilitates the growth of microscopic plants to produce healthy food ingredients, all while generating breathable oxygen and sequestrating high amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), a major contributor to climate change. At Arborea, we can finally produce clean and healthy food while harmonizing with Earth s regulatory carbon-cycles on a massive scale! MICRO + PLANTS = SUPER FOOD Micro plants such as blue-green algae and phytoplankton, are some of the most important organisms in the history of our planet. They are behind the original buildup of oxygen in the earth s atmosphere while constituting the fundamental base of life s intricate food web. They already provide food to trillions of animals. Their cells contain thousands of highly nutritious food molecules which haven t been processed by other organisms, therefore maintaining high digeribility and pristine nutritional properties. Micro plants offer an enormous amount of quality proteins, vitamins, powerful antioxidants, minerals, essential fatty acids and phytonutrients. BIOMIMICRY REINVENTING CULTIVATION We ve spent the last four years researching the best way to grow organic and healthy food ingredients with the smallest environmental impact, aiming to feed the world s present and future generations while preserving our planet. Arborea s groundbreaking cultivation technology enables a total control of optimal culturing parameters, specifically at massive scales and with the smallest energy inputs in the industry. Our food is wholly Vegan, GM-free, hormone-free, and our technology allows for completely sterile cultivation, eliminating external contamination to produce the cleanest and purest ingredients. WHY GROW FOOD WITH ARBOREA S PLANTS CULTIVATION SYSTEMS? Improving people s health Our organic food ingredients not only are substitutes for synthetic food additives, but they also add anti-oxidizing, nutritional and healthy benefits to our food. Addressing global resource constraints Our cultivation technology enables the production of the highest amount of plant-based food per square unit of surface area, while easily growing on infertile and arid land. Positively impacting climate change Just one acre of our cultivation system sequesters carbon dioxide and produces breathable oxygen, one hundred times the amount of an acre of forests. Preserving the natural environment Our food is cultivated in the cleanest natural way and our waste is basically null. Since we don t mess with soil, we preserve nature s fertility while addressing deforestation. OUR PEOPLE ARE WHAT MAKES US GREAT Arborea s award-winning team is composed of exceptional scientists and engineers from world-leading institutions such as Imperial College London, Cambridge University, and London Business School. It includes post-PhD scientific and technical expertise, combined with the commercial acumen and industry experience that is required to effectively execute our vision of a prosperous, sustainable future. Arborea receives continuous support from extraordinary scientific and business advisors, including leading professors, researchers and serial entrepreneurs from world-class organisations.

Learn more Over 500 Components In addition to the 500+ core building blocks for all aspects of an app, you can easily compose new components and then share them with others. Become part of the community! Learn more Native Performance Composer Pro produces highly optimized React Native apps, with access to all native device capabilities. Say goodbye to hybrid web apps, and welcome the 5-star app experience. Learn more Powerful Theme Engine A large library of user interface components is only helpful if you can mix and match, and use them together. With Composer Pro's theme engine you can. And it's powerful. Learn more Unlimited Logic By visually combining the hundreds of logic functions we've built, there's literally no limit to what you can create. Math, engineering, array operations, UI logic we've got you covered. Learn more Integrate APIs in Minutes With Composer Pro's REST integration wizard, you can integrate any modern API in minutes.

Build your first app in minutes Sign up for free 1. Drag-and-drop the user interface With Composer Pro, crafting your app's user interface is as easy as prototyping. But instead of putting together a prototype, you're building real software. Every imaginable style property is readily available in a menu for you to change, and you can preview the final result in real-time. Add animations, upload your custom font family, change adaptive design settings to make your mobile app beautiful on the TV screen. It feels like cheating. It's the new standard. You'll never go back to writing code for your views again. Watch video on how it works 2. Create any logic visually Imagine you had the most powerful programming language available to you, with every logic function you can think of. Sensors, file operations, data functions, permissions, user input, animations everything. And then, instead of writing code and learning the syntax, you could just drag-and-drop the functions on a canvas. And that's it. It just works. Every single parameter or variable you may want to use in your functions is automatically available. Welcome to magic. Welcome to Composer Pro. Watch video on how it works 3. Bring your own data Data is in the core of every modern application. That's why Composer Pro was built around integrations and data transformations. First we made it dead simple to add your own integrations. Then be built some ready-made integrations to get started with. And finally we added a nosql development database for you to play with. Unlike the other solutions out there, we don't want to relay your data through our servers. When you integrate your app to your backend, it connects there directly. That's what we call zero lock-in. Watch video on how it works 4. Do magic with over 400 formula functions We took a simple concept that everyone knows and spiced it up with some magic. By combining the ""spreadsheet type"" formulas with built-in support for full application context, we've built the most powerful algorithm editor you've ever seen. Combine hundreds of data transformation functions with relevant data such as the device and system info, GPS location, sensor values, data properties and the application state. What can you do with it? Calculate a distance between two coordinates. Convert date field to a local format. Predict future values based on historical data. Calculate interest rates on a mortgage. Confirm the total price when checking out a shopping cart. Basically anything you can think of, and then some. Watch video on how it works 5. Publish apps to mobile, web, tablet, TV, desktop... Once you're done building your application, it's time to ship it. You don't need to have a specific operation system to build apps for certain devices. You don't need any software to compile your code. With our free-to-use cloud build service, you can just request a binary version of your native application in a few simple steps, and it's delivered to you automatically. It's never been easier. And if you want to deploy your web app, it's as easy. Just click and release.

"Skip to content contact@newsapience.com Sapiens Test Careers Contact Login Tech Products Sapiens Product Line Caregiver Sapiens Personal Companion Sapiens Knowledge Products Applications Industries Sapiens Applications MK Applications Robotic Sapiens About Our Team Our Vision Blog Investors Search for: Loading... The CDC has projected that by 2020 157 million Americans will be affected by generally incurable and ongoing, chronic diseases representing more than 46% of the total population of this country. 50 million of these sufferers are over 65. National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2013) Summary
Health Statistics for the U.S. Population: National Health Interview Survey, 2012. Multiple Medications People who suffer from one or more chronic conditions typically need different medications and may see several different specialists. Multiple medications prescribed by different doctors can confuse patients about how and when to take their medications. This can result in taking improper or dangerous drug combinations. Medication Adherence Doctors caution patients to take medication exactly as prescribed and watch for any side effects but primary symptoms such as pain and secondary symptoms from side effects or drug interactions many contribute to memory issues or disorientation that make it difficult for patients to comply. These challenges are especially severe in the elderly. Tracking Symptoms A means of tracking patient s symptoms between doctor visits is urgently needed, especially during clinical trials. Ideally patients would log symptoms as they occur and be able to present doctors with detailed summaries on demand but this is seldom possible. Caregiver Sapiens Caregiver Sapiens admin 2020-02-02T18:13:18-05:00 Case Study Julia is a 61-year-old sufferer of idiopathic intracranial hypo-tension and poly-autoimmune syndrome. Her immune system randomly attacks healthy tissues in systems throughout the body. There is no cure and physicians are limited to treating the damaged tissues on a symptom by symptom basis. Julia sees over 10 specialists and takes 7 different medications at 15 different times during a day. She has been prescribed over 20 other medications to take as needed. She finds managing medications, tracking symptoms and making appointments an overwhelming problem. The resulting stress exacerbates her condition. The Solution New Sapience has created Machine Knowledge the world s first technology that comprehends natural human language in the same sense that humans do. MK provides an internal model of the world or domain that embodies the same concepts and relationships that people recognize as objects of their own thoughts. The result is something the world has never seen before: a digital entity with the core knowledge needed to understand the meaning of natural language words and grammar. In short, our technology can do what no other software can do because it is the only software that understands what the words mean. Each instance of our software becomes a unique individual as it learns, like a human, through reading and conversation. We call these entities sapiens. Our Patient Caregiver Sapiens will model patients, diseases, symptoms, drugs and all the knowledge needed to utilize its perfect memory and 24/7 presence to help suffers like Julia live a better life. The Caregiver Sapiens is one of several specialized medical sapiens types that comprise the AIRMED a reference architecture of communicating sapiens. AIRMED has the potential to revolutionize medicine. Capabilites Medication Compliance The sapiens will assist the patient in taking all medications in accordance with the prescribed times and conditions. An extension to this capability will be to also assist in dietary compliance when it is part of the treatment regimen. Symptom Tracking The sapiens will comprehend patient s descriptions of symptoms as they occur and will have the capacity to generate an output summary. The sapiens brings the promise of remote, noninvasive monitoring of patient status that is more personalized to improve detection of recurrence, progression, or supportive care needs. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) The success of clinical trials is high dependent upon accurate symptom monitoring. During the week as the sapiens interacts with the user it will gather the information that the patient would otherwise need to enter into the trial weekly questionnaire. At week s end the sapiens will initiate a dialog with the user to collect any missing information and automatically forward a report to the trial manager. Emergencies The sapiens will respond to Help me! type inputs and will notify appropriate first responders and provide pertinent information. Appointment Management The sapiens will assist the patient in managing appointments.

"Product Resources Company Login Request Demo Login Request a Demo Product Carriers Partners Member Case Studies Newsroom FAQ Careers Our Team Our Culture Our Office Our Board Reliable ocean shipping Improve your supply chain reliability and reduce your unbudgeted ocean freight spend NYSHEX works with six of the top ten ocean carriers to provide reliability to shippers globally. $23 billion is wasted annually which costs both shippers and carriers Carriers and shippers are caught in a vicious cycle that results in unreliability and damaged trust: Carrier and shipper expectations are often misaligned, There is limited visibility into how both parties are performing, and Issues are not resolved quickly and outcomes are not always fair. The Solution for Unreliability NYSHEX contracts have achieved a 98.4% fulfillment rate. Our solution has proven that there are three critical components to a reliable and effective shipping contract: Clarity of terms Create contracts with terms, standards, and expectations that are clear and fair. Visibility of performance Independent monitoring of carrier and shipper performance to each contract, providing details to a container event level. Exception resolution Safeguard your relationships with timely, impartial, and digital resolution of issues. When contracts are clear and binding, trust is restored and reliability is improved Shippers and carriers can plan with greater accuracy, Exceptions are resolved efficiently and amicably, and Both parties benefit from greater reliability and reduced cost. Testimonials What members are saying NYSHEX is a very innovative, but simple concept. I would recommend that any shipper seeking true visibility should take a long look at how NYSHEX could work for them.

 learning as creative tools for composition and arrangement. Bronze is also an audio
 file format which will revolutionise music playback, enabling artists to release
 non-static, generative, augmented music. Philippe Parreno, Arca and Nicolas Becker have used Bronze to create a new work which 
 will occupy the lobby of MoMA in New York for the next two years. Echo is a site-specific 
 work involving sound, light and animated physical objects. Described by the artist as an 
 auto-poetic system, the work will exist in the space, responding to itself and it s surroundings

S&P 500 TR Index data are annual compounded return calculations which are time weighted measures and are shown for reference and directional purposes only.

What Our Investors Say About Us Rajaa Mekouar-Schneider Head of PE, Single Family Office Moonfare is a true disruptor in the value chain of PE, enabling wider access to the asset class, in an innovative and seamless way, while offering a selection of top performing funds otherwise inaccessible. Leonard Clemens Founding Managing Partner, Enern Growth Capital & Cadence Growth Capital As a long-term growth private equity investor myself I have been looking for direct exposure to other PE investors for quite some time. With Moonfare I now have this opportunity. The Moonfare platform is smooth and easy to navigate and the technology enables easy access, liquidity and transparency. The platform offers an access to different funds, where I can pick and choose the strategy that best suits my portfolio and wealth management needs. Peter Damisch Senior Advisor, former MD at BCG, former EMEA EXCO member at HSBC PB Moonfare offers a great combination of unique content, great value for money and amazing convenience. It is a true pleasure using Moonfare s services. Chris hlund Founder, IRS AG I am very satisfied with the service provided by Moonfare. The fee structure is completely transparent: a one-time setup fee and annual management fee, no other hidden charges. This makes investing in private equity affordable for individuals like myself. Moonfare offers an unrivalled portfolio of high quality PE Funds with stellar track records thus providing for an investors peace of mind. Dr. Andr P. Jaeggi Former Managing Director of Adveq Moonfare has drastically lowered the barriers of entry for private equity investments offering a smooth and rapid subscription process. Thanks to the comparatively low minimal commitment sizes it allows a rapidly well diversified portfolio build-up. Norbert Reis Former Board Member, HSBC Trinkaus I found the whole Moonfare investment process to be characterised by deep investment knowledge and thorough customer orientation; all interaction is swift and the documentation is well thought-through. Michelle Capiod Former Partner, Mid Europa Partners Moonfare has developed a disruptive business model, making private equity investing easily accessible to qualified private investors. The selection of top tier funds, the easy-to-use digital interface and the transparent fee structure makes Moonfare a highly attractive investment platform, adapted for the digital age. Gisbert R hl CEO, Kl ckner & CO SE I have been impressed with the funds that Moonfare has brought to its Platform. Their selection shows me that they have both access to top managers as well as a thorough due diligence process. Picking the right managers at the right time is critical and I trust Moonfare to help me as an investor. Hannes Rumer CFO, Intersport The entire Moonfare Platform is smooth and very easy to navigate. The technology takes out the complexity normally associated with the long, complicated process of investing. Especially for someone like me, who never has enough time, the ease of use is something I value greatly. I am really happy I discovered Moonfare. Dr. Karsten Zippel Founding Partner, Alphaville Capital The quality of the funds on the Platform is a testament to the management team, the advisory board and the network of shareholders. Moonfare remains the best-in-class because of the expertise of its community who come from the industry and who are able to guide on execution. This professional backing was what gave me confidence to invest. Georg Unger Partner, Singular Group As a strategic adviser to Private Equity funds, I have been looking for direct exposure into this asset class for quite some time. With Moonfare I now have this opportunity without having to put all eggs into one basket, since I can hedge my bets across various top funds. Dr. Florian Jodl VP Partner Strategy, Zalando My first investment in private equity was through the Moonfare platform. I had been familiar with the asset class and strategy but had not yet found a way to invest that suited me. I appreciate the clear communication and transparent information throughout the process. Ron Hagen Former Executive Vice President, Oranje-Nassau Energie BV Moonfare has successfully disrupted a product that was previously only accessible to very few people. The platform allows me to invest in a diversified portfolio of Private Equity funds across geography, sector and currency. Markus Bergauer Senior Executive, Global Supply Chain What impressed me most about the Moonfare team was the due diligence they performed for fund selection. The team was not only able to secure allocations to funds by sought-after managers that suit my investment goals but also made itself available to address all of my questions throughout the process. Lien De Leenheer Managing Director, Family Office Moonfare offers us the unique possibility to cherry pick investments in superior PE funds via special purpose vehicles, thus transparent in reporting, costs, capital flow and duration. Beyond that, the qualified and personalised support from our Moonfare liaison is first class.

In Hong Kong, the platform is operated under the supervision of Moonfare Asia Ltd. (23/F One Taikoo Place, 979 King s Road, Quarry Bay, Hong Kong), an affiliate of Moonfare GmbH, and licensed with the Securities and Futures Commission (CE no. BOO902) to carry on business in Type 1 (dealing in securities) regulated activity in Hong Kong under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571). Moonfare does not make investment recommendations and no communication, through this website or in any other medium should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on or off this investment platform. Alternative investments in private placements, and private equity investments via feeder funds in particular, are speculative and involve a high degree of risk and those investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risk warnings and disclosures for the respective fund or investment vehicle set out therein. The value of an investment may go down as well as up and investors may not get back their money originally invested. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. An investment in a fund or investment vehicle is not the same as a deposit with a banking institution. Please refer to the respective fund documentation for details about potential risks, charges and expenses. Additionally, investors will typically receive illiquid and/or restricted membership interests that may be subject to holding period requirements and/or liquidity concerns. In the most sensible investment strategy for private equity investing, private equity should only be part of your overall investment portfolio. Further, the private equity portion of your portfolio may include a balanced portfolio of different private equity funds. Investments in private equity are highly illiquid and those investors who cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 10 years) should not invest.

"Home Technology Licensing About News Contact Us Select Page Plant technology for crops that do not produce seeds "" CEEDS TM technology has been developed by New Energy Farms Ltd Many global food crops, such as rice, wheat, corn and sorghum, are planted from seeds. However, half of the most important global food crops, do not produce suitable seeds and must rely on vegetative propagation. CEEDS TM technology is a very advanced form of vegetative propagation that is suitable for many crops. Sugarcane is one such example, grown on 25 million hectares and traditionally planted using stem cuttings. CEEDS TM technology can dramatically change the planting logistics. Instead of planting from 12t to almost 20 tonnes of stem material a hectare to produce new crops, CEEDS TM technology can plant around 250kg/ha of plant propagules. Cassava, banana, sweet potato, potato, yam and pineapple are examples of other vegetatively propagated crops and there are many flowers and shrubs that are multiplied by this method. This form of propagation is therefore widely used, but often needs complex supply chains to establish new fields, plantations or horticultural demands. Patented CEEDS TM technology New Energy Farms (NEF) has developed and patented CEEDS TM technology, an artificial seed system for crops that do not produce conventional seeds. CEEDS TM simplifies the complex supply chains that are often required for vegetatively produced crops. It creates many benefits : by reducing costs of production. produces propagules that can drilled like conventional row crops. reducing the quantity (weight and volume) of material that is planted. creates a more rapid method of introducing new varieties. offers an efficient field delivery mechanism for targeting crop protection products. complementary technology for tissue culture and other vegetatively propagated techniques.

"Higher Education Skills Training About ISAs Our Team Resources Get Started Helping schools help students Smarter enrollment management. Robust student support. Guidance from Vemo Education. Learn More We help schools thrive. From reimagined financial aid packaging to data-driven enrollment management, Vemo's school partners advance clear strategic objectives: higher yield, improved retention, and accelerated completion. Vemo guides schools toward comprehensive strategies that serve their students and institutional needs. With robust data collection, thoughtful program analysis, and collaborative partnership, Vemo enables continual program refinement and outcomes accountability. That s how Vemo s partners empower more students to succeed every year. Our Impact 01. Drive Enrollment Schools don t have to choose between students and seats. When schools work with Vemo Education, they become active partners in student success for more students than ever. 02. Improve Retention Why do students stop out and drop out? Identify retention inhibitors and provide targeted solutions that keep students in school. 03. Accelerate Completion What s holding students back from on-time completion? With programs designed for targeted student populations, schools can facilitate on-time completion and earlier career success. Our Partners Vemo Education has developed years-long partnerships with competitive higher education institutions and skills-based training providers. Vemo s commitment to its partnerships is matched only by the schools' commitment to make education more expansive: broader in its reach, more generous in scope, and more inclusive of students who need improved education access. Higher Education Vemo Education works with schools to identify pain points, establish clear objectives, and formulate a plan that improves institutional sustainability while increasing education access. Learn More Skills Training Vemo s alternative education team understands the competitive landscape of skills-based education. Applying rigorous analysis and industry expertise, Vemo s team can help them facilitate and maintain institutional sustainability. Learn More In 2016, Purdue University became the first major higher education institution to offer an income share agreement program when Purdue Research Foundation launched Back a Boiler. Vemo Education is a valuable partner with PRF when it comes to the design, implementation, and servicing of Back a Boiler. See the Case Study Brian Edelman President of Purdue Research Foundation Vemo Education seamlessly created income share agreement programs to support our undergraduate and graduate students that we rely on to help achieve some of our most ambitious goals access, affordability, and using educational outcomes data to prove the value of a Messiah College education. See the Case Study David Walker VP for Finance and Planning Through Invest in U, the University of Utah is investing in our students to help them succeed, recognizing that many students start and stop their educations based on
finances. See the Case Study Ruth Watkins President of The University of Utah Our Tools: ISAs and More Vemo Education takes a consultative approach to understanding a school s financial and enrollment health. Vemo then helps develop and execute on strategies that target institutions individual needs. One tool that Vemo helps schools leverage, income share agreements (ISAs), can be adapted to suit a variety of institutional types and objectives. With an ISA program, schools offer students up-front education funding in exchange for a fixed percentage of future income for a defined, finite period of time. Learn More About ISAs Our Team Vemo Education s team of experts in financial aid, higher education, and data science works in collaboration to build impactful programs at schools.

Read More A Few Examples of our Success A marketing research client of ours was facing problems assessing the veracity of the metrics, indices and charts in their reports. We developed an NLP-based text scraping and validation solution which would validate the similarity between data sources like World Bank website on one hand and a PDF report on country-wise per capita income on the other. This reduced their man-hours burden to perform the manual QA drastically saving them big bucks. A Fintech (employee loans) client of ours was about to touch a million active users. During the onboarding process, they used to ask the place of work from their users. Being a free-text field, it was prone to errors some would misspell Amazon as Amzon and others Amazin . They were missing out on critical insights about user s place of work because of this issue. We brought Levenshtein Distance based text matching to their rescue. All such misspellings were traced back to Amazon . Now they could customize their marketing campaigns for organizations for better RoIs. A client who was an ecommerce aggregator was having a hard time optimizing the search on their website. They had an overwhelming 100mn+ product listings across retailers with different catalogue category for the same product across different retailers. We used Na ve Bayes based text classification to categorize 100mn+ products to 5400 Google shopping categories. This improved their search results leading to 5x better conversions.

"Blog Careers Contact us Book a demo Truly intelligent automation for complex decisions and scenarios Poor decisions cost organisations billions yearly. Rainbird lets you build visual models of your smartest employees thought processes, then uses these models to automate decision making at rates typically 100x faster and 25% more accurate, with full explainability. Rainbird prevents billions being lost due to inconsistent, uninformed decision making. Book a demo Rainbird customers are already improving decisions to save time and money: Claims Underwriting Tax judgements Audit Legal advice Healthcare Fraud identification Anti-money laundering compliance Credit decisioning Rainbird fits in across multiple industries Finance Insurance Legal Your Sector How does Rainbird automate complex decisions? 1. Capture expertise without coding Using a visual modeller, create knowledge maps of the thought processes applied by subject matter experts in any field. Knowledge maps aren t linear (like decision trees in robotic process automation) or opaque (like machine learning models).

This means you can productise expertise and make it available at scale. 2. Ask complex questions Pose questions or scenarios to Rainbird that align with the area of knowledge covered by your map. You can do this using conversational interfaces, APIs or other systems. Rainbird will provide answers with varying levels of certainty, even when dealing with ambiguity or incomplete data. 

This improves the accuracy of nuanced, multidimensional analyses, like fraud detection. 3. Get explanations for answers Ask Rainbird why it s given you a particular answer and it will show an evidence tree of its reasoning, including all considered variables and the quantitative impact of each.

This ensures you can comply with regulations and enjoy the full confidence of customers.

"xml version=""1.0""? Index Benefits Investors Team Join us News Scientists' corner xml version=""1.0""? Index Your processor , our technology together we can break records ! Lauri Koskinen , C hief Technology Officer / Tuomas Hollman , Chief Executive Officer Abstract Choose Minima to transform your processor into a minimum-energy-point design. Our technology will enable near future fantasies such as in-body medical devices and energy harvesting. We turn science fiction into reality with science. Index terms processors, low energy consumption, design flexibility, better reliability. I Introduction. We live in an age of great technological transition and are about to take a giant leap into a vast realm of new possibilities. But, we are being held back unnecessarily: batteries that are too big, too clumsy and too easily over-heated stand in the way of the full power of IoT . But the solution exists , and it is our privilege to present it to you. Minima s record-breaking energy efficiency will enable new categories of technology . What does this mean in practice? It means that you choose a processor , and we turn it into an extraordinarily low energy consumption product that is ready for the mass market . For you, it means lower production costs, design flexibility, a wider range of applications, and greater reliability. For us, this means that we have succeeded in doing something that many have attempted with little success . II Background. Minima began as an academic research project in 2008. Since then, it has grown into a company that is backed by venture capitalists and that collaborates with top universities from Finland to Berkeley. No one else has reached minimum energy point in a way the Minima Processor has . Our world record , 3.15 pJ per operation on a 32 bit processor , lowers energy consumption up to 15 to 20X as compared to nominal voltage design. This is the key to all new technologies , including edge computing, smart dust, energy harvesting, in-body medical, voice wakeup, low-power wide area networks and IoT security.

We have developed a passenger counter (CDP) capable of reporting in real time where the buses are, and whether they are empty. Therefore, the public transport user is informed of how much time is left to reach the bus, and if it is empty. In 2018, we were awarded the best startup at Harvard and MIT during HackBrazil, which takes place at the Brazil Conference. We are currently testing the people counting system in real time on several buses in Brazil. Marcel Ogando after the partnership meeting with Metra S founding partners working at EMTU Laboratories (E-Lab) Passenger Counter We have hardware with technology developed by us that collects important data about the flow of passengers on the bus and sends to our application and to our platform. Fleet Management Scale your fleet in real time so that it adequately serves the number of passengers at the points and facilitates long-term fleet planning. Line Efficiency Find out the average time that passengers spend on each bus line and the main points of departure and arrival. Preventive Maintenance Be warned when the bus has mechanical and electrical failures or needs periodic maintenance. Empty bus Provide information to the passenger which bus is empty in real time, for a better leveling of people on the buses. Embarkation and Disembarkation Find out which are the points of greatest embarkation and disembarkation thousand bus product Your Most Efficient Fleet We work with the most advanced technologies of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to perform the flow count. people on buses . So, we developed a Hardware and a Platform. Hardware: Connected inside the bus and connected to the vehicle's electronic central, it is possible to generate the identification, in real time, of the number of passengers boarding and disembarking the bus. Platform: Through the data obtained from the hardware, our platform is fed, which allows managers to understand in real time the displacement of people and, in addition, create strategies to reduce or increase the use of vehicles. The platform itself generates a routing system, heat map and a complete dashboard. mil nio bus time CEO Renato Rodrigues profile Production Engineer and is currently studying a Master's in Production Engineering at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFScar).

"Our Deep Learning is in orbit Mission KnowHow Product News Investors Careers About Autonomous space missions AIKO research-centered, innovative and futuristic mission is clear: developing
						algorithms infused
						with Artificial
						Intelligence, to increase the autonomy of current space missions. Artificial Intelligence has entered a new period of scientific relevance. It's time to leap from the traditional, rigid, Earth-bound space systems to autonomous, sentient ones . Scientific data must be prioritized, telemetry data must
					be
					interpreted with improved
					accuracy, failures must be mitigated, design must be optimized. AI-based algorithms not only offer increased performances with respect to traditional architectures, but are an enabling technology for advanced mission concepts. Investor relations GEMINEA invests in AIKO GEMINEA ( www.geminea.com ),
					Milan-based VC focused on Artificial Intelligence startups, invests in AIKO and in its vision of
					using AI
					to enable autonomous space missions. The round is aimed at consolidating the team and the company to
					achieve a
					higher level in the technology development. We look forward to a shared path of growth and success! SEED ROUND IN 2019 AIKO is currently setting up the Seed Round, targeted at mid 2019. The
					objectives
					of the round are to space qualify our technology (it's only software!) and to consolidate company
					structure. Things we look for in an investor: smart money, strategy, network . We put the dream team, the vision, the commitment . Get in touch: drop us an email . ESA INVESTMENT FORUM 2019 AIKO selected by ESA among the 14 startups invited at the ESA Investment
					Forum 2019,
					in Darmstadt, Germany at the European Space Operations Centre ESA/ESOC. Event information here: EventBrite . Autonomous operations library Enabling e4 autonomy MiRAGE is an innovative software library to enable fully autonomous space missions, making use of
					state of the
					art
					Artificial Intelligence and is the result of years of research in Mission Autonomy. The library has been co-funded by the H2020 program SME Instrument. The Concept MiRAGE operates by analyzing the data made available during the mission
					(telemetry
					payload and external data) to generate and update the operations schedule. The satellites become
					aware,
					understanding
					their surroundings, the internal health, and eventual commands provided by the Mission Control
					Centre. MiRAGE
					library enables autonomous decisions during a mission, tailored to the needs of the end-users and
					the mission
					stakeholders. Enabled benefits Planning and scheduling is a very resource-intensive activity during most
					of space
					missions.
					Performing schedule changes in reaction to unplanned mission events is even more challenging, due to
					poor
					predictability
					of these occurrences, to the necessity of having staff on-site 24/7, and to the quick reaction times
					requested in
					order
					to reduce eventual mission outages. By shifting the decision-making on-board the satellite,
					MiRAGE library
					eliminates
					the decision-making loop in the Mission Control Centre for all the events that were accounted for
					during
					spacecraft development, including failures, events related to mission objectives, or events
					generated by other
					elements in a constellation. Operators still maintain highest priority in commanding the
					spacecraft: they are
					now
					just focusing on more critical decisions that might still require ground intervention. We implement the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence research
					to enable awareness on the satellite and to perform event detection. Our AIs are trained with
					datasets generated
					on purpose for each feature selected in MiRAGE: failure detection, payload analysis, pattern
					recognition including
					novely
					detection. Moreover, predictions are enabled during the mission: if certain trends are likely to
					result in a
					future Out Of Limit alert, our AIs are able to warn operators ahead of time. By using MiRAGE, more complex missions are at reach: tracking features on
					the
					surface, activating
					enhanced acquisition modes, selecting and prioritizing payload downlinked data. The result is
					increased
					efficiency, mission objectives are fulfilled sooner, and downlink bandwidth is occupied only with
					relevant data. Reducing operations costs The real, long-term benefit of fully autonomous mission is the reduction
					of the operations costs. This is particularly important for small satellite missions, where
					operations costs have
					been
					shown not to scale with spacecraft size, and for constellations, where the high number of operators
					per spacecraft
					simply
					cannot be afforded with hundreds, thousands of satellites. TRL and Compatibility MiRAGE, currently at TRL 6, is scheduled to reach TRL 7 by end of 2018. The on-board version is compatible with Linux-based OS, while the
					ground-based
					one
					supports
					Win/Unix/Mac OS architectures. We believe future space missions will be fully autonomous, and our technology is the enabler. Interested in seeing MiRAGE live? Request

					Colorado, US. The collaboration will be focused on evaluating the implementation of Machine Learning
					algorithms for a Mars
					SmallSat
					mission concept. The Space Science Institute (SSI) is a nonprofit research and education corporation based in
					Boulder (CO,
					USA) with
					a vision to expand humankind's understanding and appreciation of planet Earth, our Solar System, and
					the universe
					beyond.
					SSI is home to more than 60 scientists carrying out cutting edge research in astrophysics, planetary
					science, and
					space
					physics. It is also a leader in translating science into education and outreach projects, and it was
					home to the
					Cassini
					Imaging Science Subsystem Ops team, which provided the best pictures of Saturn, its rings, and moons
					until the end
					of
					NASA's Cassini mission. Image source:
					NASA. Processing:
					AIKO. The project opens an important commercial direction for AIKO, with the first collaboration aimed at
					the
					implementation of
					AI-based algorithms for interplanetary missions. Small Satellites are characterized by severe
					limitations, that
					make
					their utilization in interplanetary missions challenging. AIKO algorithms are an enabling technology
					that will
					make
					future Small Satellites missions to other planets possible. 01/09/2018 ESA Advanced Concepts Team Deep Learning for spacecraft applications AIKO starts a collaboration with ESA Advanced Concepts Team , ESTEC, The
					Netherlands. The collaboration will focus on developing a tool for evaluating the computational requirements
					for deep
					learning state
					of the art algorithms for embedded applications. The outcome of the project will allow an user to estimate, given a specific or custom
					architecture of Deep
					Neural Network,
					the computational requirements of the algorithm. In particular, information such as operation
					counts, memory
					utilization
					and inference time for each processor will be displayed. The tool represents an initial step towards
					promoting the
					diffusion
					and utilization of Artificial Intelligence in space applications and will be provided as a freely
					available web
					application
					on AIKO website. The Advanced Concepts Team (ACT) is part of the ESA s Directorate of Technical and Quality Management (TEC-SF). The team is
					essentially a
					channel for
					the study of technologies and ideas that are of strategical importance in the long term planning of
					the Agency. It
					serves
					the function of a think tank providing decision makers the support of a highly multidisciplinary
					research group.
					Based
					at ESTEC, they carry out research work on advanced topics and emerging technologies and perform
					highly skilled
					analysis
					on a wide range of topics. PRIVACY AIKO does not handle personal data. For additional enquiries, please
					contact privacy@aikospace.com 30/04/2019 In-orbit demonstration agreement Deep Learning for Earth Observation applications AIKO signs an agreement with Satellogic ( satellogic.com ), an Earth Observation satellite company to validate Deep
					Learning technology. The activity will be carried out within Satellogic's Software and Hardware
					Hosted Payloads Program during 2019. Why this is important for us In-orbit validation is a key step in order to improve AIKO heritage. The Technology Readiness Level
					of AIKO
					technology will reach the status of TRL 9: demonstrated in real mission scenario. AIKO's technology enables more ambitious commercial and scientific goals for Earth
					Observation missions, as an increased degree of on-board autonomy helps in implementing more
					effective
					mission operations. In particular, functionalities like event detection, autonomous planning and
					goal management, if implemented on-board, introduce several benefits to the way operations are
					managed.
					The deep learning opens new possibilities and horizons, such as: Prioritization and payload data selection Onboard data enhancing In addition to the activities carried out during the program, AIKO will further improve its internal
					procedures for implementing and optimizing Deep Learning software in the context of space systems
					on-board execution.
					Given this opportunity, AIKO further consolidates its role in the Space industry, as provider of
					automation and Artificial Intelligence solutions, dramatically expanding its know-how and expertise. A sincere thank you to Satellogic for the opportunity! Facilities AIKO premises are located in the I3P
						incubator of
					Politecnico di Torino, Italy, ranked in 2014 among the top 25
					best incubators in the world. AIKO offices are equipped with the needed infrastructure to carry out
					modern
					engineering activities related to AIKO background. This includes, Artificial Intelligence design and
					training,
					software R&D, teleconferences and concurrent engineering. AIKO makes use of state of the art cloud
					computing
					infrastructure provided by Google, NVIDIA and Microsoft, in addition to local GPU-enabled resources
					available to
					each AIKO engineer. AIKO offices are located in Torino, in a central location fully connected to train and bus station,
					and within

 transmission and storage needs, to improving the clarity of voice files being fed to speech 
 recognition pipelines or conference calls. VAUX was founded by Meaghan White, Lindsay Watt and Chris Gage with Mawson in July 2018.

 successfully founding an educational robotics company and leading

The Umbrella was selected by a jury composed of some of the most influential professionals and policy-makers in New York City. The Urban Umbrella product is the culmination of two years of intense engineering reviews and testing with the NY DOB. The Umbrella's architects and engineers produced over 100 configuration options and 450 pages of structural analysis for personal review by the Department's Chief Structural Engineer Dan Eschenasy.The Umbrella is the first design alternative to the sidewalk shed in over 50 years. contact us for a quote 20 Harrison Street, New York, NY 10013, USA sALES @urbanumbrella.com Send @Urban_Umbrella Follow (212) 651-0305.The Umbrella is the first design alternative to the sidewalk shed in over 50 years. contact us for a quote 20 Harrison Street, New York, NY 10013, USA sALES @urbanumbrella.com Send @Urban_Umbrella Follow (212) 651-0305. contact us for a quote 20 Harrison Street, New York, NY 10013, USA sALES @urbanumbrella.com Send @Urban_Umbrella Follow (212) 651-0305.The Umbrella is the first design alternative to the sidewalk shed in over 50 years. contact us for a quote 20 Harrison Street, New York, NY 10013, USA sALES @urbanumbrella.com Send @Urban_Umbrella Follow (212) 651-0305",0

What we are working on Our mission is to effectively simplify medical routines in hospitals and in home-care. We want to enrich the world with our intelligent innovations. Our goal Our vision is to become an indispensable partner in the medical field - through a well thought out concept and perfect technical implementation.

Marketing Development of classic and digital PR and marketing strategies as well as conception, implementation, evaluation and optimisation of marketing campaigns. Operations Duties in the areas of purchasing, production planning and logistics - from contract negotiations to logistics concepts and returns processing. The sensor patch The intelligent plaster that measures and records temperatures until the next reading. Our temperature measurement solutions are based on a temperature-sensitive sensor that is placed under the armpit, in the form of a temperature measuring adhesive patch, which is activated by a smartphone. This high-tech patch continuously measures and records the current temperature levels at predetermined time intervals. When required the data can be viewed on an NFC-enabled smartphone, evaluated and displayed on the screen in our specially developed apps. Automation Precise and simple temperature measurement that works almost by itself. Comfort Discrete temperature measurement - flexible, skin-friendly and medically tested. Regularity Continuous temperature monitoring instead of inaccurate intermittent measurements. Hygiene The single-use of the temperature measuring patches reduces the risk of infection. Close NFC A method of transmission that is as simple as contactless payment in the supermarket. NFC stands for ""Near Field Communication"" and is a technology which enables contactless data transmission between two endpoints. It is fast and very resource-efficient. With an NFC-able handheld device or smartphone, our temperature measuring patch is activated after application. If required, the temperature data, which the sensor records automatically at specified time intervals, can then be evaluated. Our specially developed app analyses the data and displays the processed information on the screen. No radio wave pollution No permanent exposure to rays, as data is only transmitted for a few seconds during the reading process. Proven a million times over World-renowned through electronic passports and contactless payment. High Security No ""listening in"" from third parties due to the very short reading distances. Simplicity of Use Works with any NFC-enabled smartphone. Close The Software Our development team s solution to breathing life into series of measurements.

On the one hand we develop apps for our end customers, and on the other hand, as original equipment manufacturers, we make OEM libraries available to our partners for incorporation into their systems.

They provide the specialist technology, advice and support for everyone to benefit from the fun, friendship and inclusion of video games.

Unlike other companies, we strive to be transparent, pay our tutors top rates, and give back to the community. Learn more about us Gooroo tutors are educators and mentors ready to help your child I love being able to share knowledge and skills with my students, watching them grow and learn so much in the process. When teaching robotics, I make sure our sessions are interactive, making the environment conducive to learning while simultaneously making the student feel comfortable. Not only does this increase the student's confidence but it also helps me get to know them and their learning styles a little better. Masuma Somji, teaches robotics Gooroo lets me connect with students that I share common passions with. For example, with one student, I not only helped boost his SAT scores but also worked with him on a short film for his college application. Whether it s with math, ELA, literature, or French, I always bring my love of learning to what I teach. Julian Bass-Krueger, teaches vocabulary I believe a warm and encouraging environment helps students learn best. Every instructional strategy that I employ for my students are highly individualized, tailored to their unique needs in learning. During my three years of teaching experience, many of my students have overcome their challenges, successfully attaining grades of B+ and above. Akira Wong, teaches biology Every time I meet a new student my three main goals are always to find the level at which they feel comfortable with the material, engage the parent(s) in the process so they understand what their child is working on, and find ways to motivate the student to get them to want to learn more every session. James Chapman, teaches physics My students needs is what matters the most to me. I initiate a plan to meet students individual goals. I also adjust my instructional style to fit students interest, learning styles and other special needs. Joy Dong, teaches ESL As a student of computer science myself, I know the trials one must go through to understand and ultimately fall in love with the field. It is easy to feel shy in the face of a challenging problem, which is why I push my students to do better than what they think they are capable of in those moments. Gooroo provides insight into how my students learn which greatly aids in the process teaching a student how to think like a computer scientist. Louis Boguslav, teaches AP computer science Meet our Tutors How We Vet Tutors What parents say about Gooroo... Gooroo made it super easy to connect each of my daughters with their perfect tutor. The new membership platform encourages them to get help from their Gooroo tutors without hesitation and has developed a regular tutor/study regime. Phil P.

Watch Video Close Testimonials Previous Next Roofing Quotes and Estimates We don't need to go into great detail on the importance of your roof. You're already aware that it is the cover that allows you and your family to enjoy a protected living space and the reason why you can live in the most extreme weather without feeling its impact. You also know that the roof over your heads is probably the largest, most expensive part of your home when it comes to replacing or repairing it. And there's no escaping that inevitability. Roof repair is something your home is eventually going to need. Being exposed to the forces of nature as it is on a daily basis, suffering the consequences of rain, snow, hail, wind and even more brutal natural phenomena, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, make even the sturdiest roof wear and decay in the long term. Roofr will be by your side when you are considering such an important project, connecting you with the right roofing contractor to give you the right roofing quote to get to the finish line on time and without stress. What Goes Into a Roof Replacement or Repair Quote A professional roofer can provide you with a roofing quote, including the most accurate representation of the materials and labor that will be involved in your home's roof repair or replacement. Roofing Repair Quotes To get to this number, your roof will have to be thoroughly inspected to understand what issues need to be addressed. The shingles, flashing, chimneys, and underlayment must be inspected to determine their health. If your inside ceiling has water stains or cracks, it could be an indication that you have one or more leaks. Your attic and ventilation shafts may also show signs of damage. Depending on the age of the roof and its condition, you'll have to determine whether to repair or replace the roof. Repairing a roof is usually the more economical route unless you have an older roof that will need to be replaced in the next few years. Roof Replacement Quotes The cost of a roof replacement depends largely on the surface area of your roof and the types of materials that you may want to use. Generally, the more expensive materials, like clay or concrete tiles, last longer. You may be able to save money on your reroofing by choosing asphalt shingles or some other less-expensive material. The roof replacement quote should cover the project's scope, materials that fit your taste and budget, and a timeline of the work to be performed. A qualified roofer will even provide you with samples of the roofing system being considered for your home. What is Roofr? In 2016 Richard Nelson, a third-generation roofer with over 15 years' experience in the roofing industry Toronto, Ontario, Canada set out to change the way people get their roofs replaced or repaired. He founded Roofr because he wanted to address the problems he saw in his own industry. He wanted homeowners to be well informed on the price of a new roof.

Leveraging the Bold Metrics machine learning technology, we turned data into action and algorithms into accurate recommendations, so our customers get a great fit. Kelly Helthall, VP Digital & Analytics Fashion Metric has completely changed our business and allowed us to become a national brand overnight. They solved a major challenge. Bert Emanuel, Founder & CEO If you have to go into the store and get a scan or get fitted, it can take a lot of energy, so inputting what you know about your size and creating a 3D body model is the easiest experience for a consumer. Ryan Leahy, Co-founder & CEO With the help of Fashion Metric, we have virtually eliminated fit as a reason that users may not convert. Cali Brutz, Co-founder & CEO I just want to say that I m so incredibly impressed with Bold Metrics. We ve done more suit testing with custom measurements using Fashion Metric, and they fit fantastically. We tested 3 body types (2 of them being in the 300lbs range) and both have said it s the best fitting suit they ve had. Keren Kang, Co-founder & CEO We met Bold Metric 2.5 years ago at SXSW and since then it s been a fantastic voyage. They are the most reliable and responsive technical vendor we ve worked without date. The body metric prediction software is extremely accurate and brings so much value to our clients. Leon Wu, Founder I looked at every self measuring tool on the market before settling on Bold Metrics. Sometimes simpler is better and from a user experience perspective it can t be beaten. Not only is it more accurate than smartphone apps; we were able to customize it to our unique product line and serve customers around the world.

We have asked all of our employees to follow the federal, local, and the Centers for Disease Control guidelines for prevention. You can learn more about those guidelines here ( link ).

In that regard, we can assist you in a smooth transition in that area via our remote learning technology. Here s how: We have pre-populated Trivie with critical COVID-19 information from the CDC, The World Health Organization, and Harvard Medical School, so you can engage employees with this information now and in the weeks ahead. This content is free to use; We are offering free onboarding and launch services for Trivie; and We are including free, full-suite analytics to identify where our clients may have knowledge risks on COVID-19 (so they can address in real-time).

Security It s always our priority, so we protect your information with bank-level encryption. Here's what Lendeavor members are saying. Dr. Derek Petersen, DDS Broomfield, CO Lendeavor helped me refinance my practice loan and obtain funds to
expand into a new treatment room. The terms they were able to offer
me allowed me to expand my production capacity while keeping cash
flow in check. Other lenders made great offers, but in the end, the
Lendeavor team was the one to deliver. Dr. Shawn Benso, DDS Phoenix, AZ Lendeavor was with me every step of the way while I purchased my new
practice, really taking the time to get to know me and understand my
strengths.
Their support helped give me the confidence I needed to move forward with
this next phase of my life. I am so thankful Lendeavor was there to help
me accomplish my dream. Dr. Melanie Frogozo, OD, FAAO, FSLS San Antonio, TX Before Lendeavor, we struggled at times to secure financing for our optometry
practice. The issue was that lenders were not experienced with our type of business.
Lendeavor vetted us as thoroughly as our previous lender but offered more
transparency and flexibility . A dedicated agent assisted us every step of the way
 which, combined with an online dashboard, made the process as easy as possible.
We look forward to growing our practice with Lendeavor! Dr. Anas Najm, DDS San Diego, CA I worked with Lendeavor during the purchase of my first dental practice. Buying a practice
is complicated, and you need to surround yourself with experienced professionals. I can't
imagine coping with that stress without Lendeavor by my side. I had offers from multiple
lenders, and Lendeavor was by far the most efficient and responsive, with a great online
system. By giving me access to all the dental practice listings in California, and by
sharing their network of connections, they helped make my dream come true. Dr. Michelle Hung, OD Houston, TX Lendeavor financed the purchase of my dream optometry practice two blocks from our home!
From our first conversation, James listened to our goals, answered our questions, and
worked diligently on our behalf. Lendeavor s portal streamlined the process by allowing
us to securely upload our financials and check for updates. Our closing specialist
provided amazing personalized service and helped us overcome several obstacles -- including
Hurricane Harvey! Our family is very appreciative of Lendeavor s support,
and we look forward to years of partnership. Dr. Smita Rewari, DDS Austin, TX First practice, first business, first commercial loan -- it was daunting at first,
but thanks to our friendly and patient closing officer and to the user-friendly
dashboard that allowed us to populate required documents easily and seamlessly,
the process was very intuitive from start to close. I would definitely recommend
Lendeavor to my colleagues and will use them in a heartbeat for any additional
business practice ventures in the future.

We aim to accelerate and augment functional recovery of people with spinal cord injury, and to improve their quality of life. Preliminary clinical results are confirming a series of scientific breakthroughs developed in animal models over the past 15 years. Featured in Nature The initial results of STIMO, the safety and feasibility study with the Targeted Epidural Spinal Stimulation system in combination with over-ground robot assisted rehabilitation training for people with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), were published in the November 1st issues of Nature and Nature Neuroscience . Latest News 20 Mar 2020: Spinal Cord Injury Community Personal Opinions and Perspectives on Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCIPOP-SCS) Research Survey The Praxis Institute is a Canadian-based not-for-profit organization that leads global collaboration in spinal cord injury research, innovation and care. They accelerate the translation of discoveries and best practices into improved treatments for people with spinal cord injuries. GTX medical supports initiatives from the Praxis Institute. Praxis partnered with NASCIC on an online research survey about perspectives on spinal cord stimulation. This research survey was co-created by people with lived experience of SCI to identify priorities, share expectations and assess demand for spinal cord stimulation. We re seeking input from people with lived experience of SCI and their primary caregivers about their opinions on this area of research. If you are interested, please take the research survey here: https://survey.givingopinions.ca/c132 It should take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete and will be available until Tuesday, March 31, 2020. 22 Oct 2019: Press Release: GTX medical BV and NeuroRecovery Technologies Inc.

Individuals The MUJO private clinic offers patients a non-invasive, drug free treatment option to target chronic pain and restore function. Our Partners Testimonials I used the MUJO devices 5 days a week, during which time I noticed improvements to my strength and appeared to help in reducing my shoulder pain. I found using the machine easier than my previously prescribed physiotherapy exercises which relied on my technique to be correct in order to activate the correct muscle group. Sally Occupational Therapist , Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust The recent use of the MUJO system as part of the post-operative rehabilitation of one of our first team players at Wasps has been of great value. The system functioned effectively as a rehabilitation tool to accurately optimise proprioception and muscle capacity in functional positions as well as being able to map the progress of the rehabilitation. Ali James Head of Physiotherapy , Wasps RFC I am a physio and I have had shoulder problems for over 18 months. The MUJO machine is an essential part of my current rehabilitation. I only started using the machine about 1 month ago and already there has been a great improvement. For any of my patients with shoulder instability, like myself, I would 100% recommend they try the MUJO. It is great because it helps you to isolate specific muscle contractions and you receive continual visual feedback on the iPad screen that tells you if you are doing the exercise correctly and motivates.

Regular pain assessments are of even greater importance for the vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic as chronic pain may be associated with an impaired immune system. (1) In the community, more than 50% of those living with dementia experience pain daily. In aged care homes around 60-80% of people living with dementia regularly experience pain. (2) PainChek accurately assesses pain for these vulnerable people living with dementia and cognitive impairment and who cannot verbalise or self-report pain reliably. PainChek also allows carers to safely and rapidly conduct a pain assessment that complies with the government s social distancing requirements, minimising risks for both carers and residents.

Introducing PainChek s Shared Care Program Changing the way pain is managed in the home. LEARN MORE Our Clients Our Partners and Supporters Testimonials When conducted a retrospective audit of pain assessments from December 2017 to March 2018 and compared it with same period of previous year (December 2016 to March 2017), we have had a 72% increase in the number of pain assessments completed since we introduced PainChek . This has also meant that we have had more pain interventions applied, including PRN medications and therapy-based solutions for pain . Matt Kowald Barossa Village General Manager We have a strong history of engaging technology to assist our residents with dementia.
It is our hope that PainChek will more efficiently identify pain in non-verbal residents, allowing us to appropriately manage pain for their comfort. Graham Francis SwanCare This technology allows consultants who have been called to assist with someone where behaviour impacts on their care to assess and identify if that person is in pain. Associate Professor Colm Cunningham Director of the Dementia Centre for HammondCare Genuine issue and super promising with human application of machine learning to ease one of the many challenges of living with dementia. The system has been tested and peer reviewed and from a design and impact perspective is just plain excellent. Good Design Good Design Awards Jury Since the introduction of PainChek, residents have suffered less pain and enjoy more of each day. It s so beneficial and efficient both time and financial wise. It has changed the treatment plans of some residents. Jill Allsopp Anthem Care Systems Manager I see PainChek as an evolutionary development of my past work, incorporating new technologies including smart devices and artificial intelligence that further improves the pain assessment process. There are many people who still do not have their pain assessed effectively. Our common goal is to ensure they do not suffer unnecessary pain. Dr Jennifer Abbey Founder of the Abbey Pain Scale Having the evidence to support a pain diagnosis has often proved difficult when caring for people with dementia. Pain and behaviour management often go hand in hand and PainChek has provided us with a simple but effective tool to diagnose that a person has pain and effectively manage that pain. As a result, we now have a number of documented cases of reduced use of behaviour Medication and an improvement in the quality of life for the residents. One resident who displayed severe behaviour and always denied pain has shown a significant improvement thanks to PainChek identifying that she did in fact have pain despite previous pain assessments not substantiating this. We see the PainChek application as a valuable addition to our pain management system. The training and support from the staff at PainChek has been first class and the Registered nurses at Regents Garden have embraced this tool and have nothing but praise for the results that we are finding.

Watches, for centuries, have shown time as moving forwards. We realised that people could better perceive the value of time if shown as the remaining amount they had for their next event, or to the end of their day, instead of as an absolute value that is common for all. We set out to challenge the conventional way of looking at time.

"Skip to content The Energy Saving Experts Menu Features About us Services AMP Energy Portal Insight Knowing more Contact We are |We are Responsible Power |Energy Savings Experts. Join us & start saving. |Get started now and make a difference. Get Started Why choose us? Features Saving energy in the hospitality sector. Energy is the second biggest operational cost in the hotel and hospitality sector behind payroll. Yet it is often treated as a fixed cost, with occasional attempts at reduction. Our extensive experience in the hospitality sector allows us to diagnose the target consumption for any hotel, and then work with management to achieve it. RP turns energy consumption into a manageable variable cost, thus increasing bottom line profit. Economic benefits Savings on electricity bills from 15% to over 20% depending on the age and efficiency of the buildings and a guarantee that the savings will exceed the programme costs. Operational benefits Improved efficiency in managing and operating power systems, resulting in greater control, greater reliability and, potentially, reduced maintenance. Environmental benefits Less energy wasted translates into a reduced carbon footprint and demonstrable commitment to sustainability and social corporate responsibility. What we do About Us Responsible Power is a privately owned company with extensive experience working together with the hospitality industry. Our mission is to increase our business customers profit and to reduce their carbon footprint by helping them put into action energy efficiency measures. We believe that before making any energy saving capital investment decision, or indeed any process or behavioural change, clients should first understand their energy consumption profile. Only then can you be sure that you can truly measure the impact of any energy efficiency actions and ensure you are making a decision based upon evidence and not just intuition. As the next step, we help our customers implement the necessary change and follow through with long term sustainable support. We apply intelligence and evidence-based decision making to the process and we provide comprehensive management reports that detail consumption in hospitality industry terms. Our Services Our goal is to provide you with effective, sustainable and cost effective energy saving solutions. We have got proven success with energy savings of up to 20% for the hotel industry. Our services include: Survey We conduct a simple, non-intrusive site survey to ascertain the optimal installation set-up which enables us to present a comprehensive proposal. Live Energy Monitoring We install live trackers, which capture live consumption information, enabling you to understand the distribution of energy use among the different areas of the business. Bespoke reporting We offer you a detailed energy analysis conducted by our Engineers based on measured consumption and our internal database and experience in the hospitality sector. AMP Energy Portal You will have access to this dedicated tool, which allows a daily control of energy use in a visual and interactive way Support for decision making Feasibility studies with non-biased, state-of-the-art information and knowledge about energy efficiency technologies, helping you plan and implement savings projects and initiatives. Savings verification We provide verification of each saving initiative undertaken, whether driven by behaviour change, process change or capital investment. The AMP effect explained Insight Responsible Power uses the latest technology combined with expert knowledge to deliver energy savings. Any consultancy engagement consists of 3 stages: Discovery what is the current situation. Analysis what can be improved and the effect that it would have. Reporting results and recommendations on improvements. This cycle is repeated on a regular basis. We have automated the discovery stage through the use of permanent energy monitoring throughout the site, collecting data from many different locations. This data is then processed on our servers, delivering up-to-date information to our expert analysts as well as the staff. Our analysts, all of whom are MSc level qualified engineers, work with the site s management to define reasonable energy consumption targets that allow for weather, level of business and any other factors that may affect energy consumption. Through access to our real-time Active Management Portal (AMP), each facility can direcly monitor and control its energy consumption. Any anomalies can be spotted and dealt with when they happen, whether caused by staff behaviour, maintenance issues or infrastructure problems. Powerful data provides powerful savings after all, knowledge is power! Please click on the images below to access a selection of case studies: Implementing behavioural change Optimising use of heating and AC Upgrading to more efficient lighting What our clients say Derek McDonagh Macdonald Hotels Regional Managing Director I find the new portal a great tool which is simple to understand, easy to navigate and it is very clear in its reporting. The reports give critical information we can use to enable immediate business decisions to be taken in regards to energy usage and savings. I have used this analysis to make informed decisions by identifying return on investment within future capital expenditure. I have also found the engineers to be engaging and they genuinely want to make this work for the property, they are proactive and readily available to go through the challenges and more importantly how to overcome them. Brett Ingle Macdonald Inchyra Hotel and Spa Macdonald Inchyra Hotel and Spa ""During my time as General Manager of the Inchyra we saved as much as 23% on energy consumption by using Responsible Power to show us where to focus, be it behaviour, maintenance, or capital investments. They told me exactly when and where energy was being wasted, and enabled me to promote our green credentials to both our customers and staff. In energy terms I knew exactly how my hotel was performing department by department."" John Philipson Macdonald Hotels and Resorts Regional Managing Director Heathrow I have worked with Responsible Power for the last 12 months and since working with them have found their commitment to supporting me and the managers on reducing waste in energy has been very useful in reducing our costs and waste in this area. 
With the introduction of the online data and daily guidance we have seen this improve even further. 
They make it easy to make energy waste a focus in the hotels and organisation and we see the value and benefits daily. Do you want to know more? How do we get there? The steps to energy saving Our Energy accountability programme enables hotel staff and management to capture significant additional profitability by reducing inefficiencies and thus the amount of energy wasted. It consists of three phases: Finding invisible problems faster Thermal Imaging Heating accounts for 40% of the energy consumption in an average building, so an increase in heat loss through its fabric can drastically raise energy bills. Using thermal imaging technology Green credentials Carbon footprint Investing in energy efficiency is widely considered a sound business practice: it allows your business to reduce expenses while at the same time reducing carbon dioxide emissions associated with energy Get in touch Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Company Name Your Message We would love to hear from you!

"Facebook Twitter Emotion Synthesis Products Emotion Chip SoC Cloud Solution SaaS ExoCar Automotive ExoLife Gaming aRadar Sensor Music4Book Order News Contact 0 $ 0.00 Emotion Synthesis Products Emotion Chip SoC Cloud Solution SaaS ExoCar Automotive ExoLife Gaming aRadar Sensor Music4Book Order News Contact Emoshape offer Emotion Synthesis by SaaS and SoC. EMOSHAPE predicts that before the end of this century humans will talk more to sentient machines than to other humans. The use of emotion remains a fundamental need for humans, one that cannot be addressed by today s emotion technology. Read more Emoshape Inc. is dedicated to providing an edge computing solution (cloud / chip) that teaches intelligent objects how to interact with humans to yield a favourable, positive result. Emoshape emotion synthesis chip (EPU) technology represents a massive leap for Artificial Intelligence, especially in the realm of self-driving cars, personal robotics, sentient virtual reality, affective toys, IoT, pervasive computing, and other major consumer electronic devices. Applications including human-machine interaction, emotion speech synthesis, emotional awareness, emotion reasoning, machine emotional intimacy, AI s personalities, machine learning and affective computing. Fields as diverse as medicine, advertising, and gaming will significantly benefit from the Emotion Processing Unit (EPU II). The growing presence of AI, robotics and virtual reality in society as a whole dictates that meaningful emotional interaction is core to removing the barrier to widespread adoption. Computers will possess emotions and personality Ray Kurzweil. Imagine intelligent machines able to truly understand and sense what they say; sentient robots able to modulate their voice, facial expressions and body language by the intensity of their emotions; advanced affective agents (AAA) in soft toys; driverless cars capable of responding faster when making complex decisions by emotional reasoning; and robots developing their own unique personalities, learning from humans interactions. We invite you to take part in the future; in making the world a better place by giving intelligent machines empathy for humans, to help create a positive future. Consumer Products Read More THE EXOLIFE PROJECT EPU III EVALUATION KIT EMOTION PROCESSING UNIT The EPU III Evaluation Kit provides an evaluation platform for the Emotion Processing Unit III. The evaluation board is a vehicle to test and evaluate the emotion synthesis functionality of the EPU III. The kit gives developers immediate access to its advanced emotion processing engine, while allowing them to develop proprietary capabilities that provide true differentiation. The EPU USB dongle gold surface is built around the revolutionary EPU III and uses the same Emoshape EPU III computing core functionalities for emotion synthesis and real-time appraisal. This gives you a fully functional EPG platform for very rapidly developing and deploying emotion capabilities for AI, Robots, consumer electronics, and more. Emoshape delivers the entire BSP and software stack available for Windows 64 bit Linux x86 and 64 bit Raspberry Pi Linux ARM and TBA for Android and OS X. With a complete suite of development, code sample, EPG machine learning cloud computing, and profiling tools, Emoshape gives you the ideal solution for helping shape the future of AI and Robot s emotional awareness. The EPU III helps to create fast and self sustaining reacting robots in complex decision problems. EPU III Brochure - Download Advanced Affective Agent Python Open Source Build Your Advanced Affective Agent (AAA) with personality and feelings in less than 15 minutes! The AAA Project allows anyone to create and interact with an emotionally concise intelligence via conversation, music, and visual media. Over time, the advanced affective agent creates a customized Emotional Profile Graph (EPG), which collects and measures a unique emotional input from the user. The EPU allows to create an Artificial Intelligence able to appraise and virtually feel senses such as pleasure, pain and expresses desires. The AAA is open to everyone including toy, IoT, and consumer electronic manufacturers with free python code on GitHub and image ready for Raspberry Pi. The AAA license is based on Apache software license 2.0 used by Android. Know More Competitive Advantage of Emotion Synthesis Emotion synthesis The Future of Robotics and virtual agents What sets EPU apart in the industry is the fact that it is not only capable of understanding and generating any emotional state, but it accomplishes this task in by wave computing . As a result, the chip can control in real-time the different facial micro expressions (FACS ) and body languages of a robot or an avatar as Rachel . The Emotion Processing Unit or EPU will also pave the way for the next generation of NLP, commonly referred to as Natural Language Generation. In this natural language processing system, the agent determines a thought or intent, and builds a meaningful response dynamically by putting different words together. Therefore, the emotional state of the EPU can be considered to be a property that will get transferred to a Natural Language Generation system, leading to the generation of Augmented Emotional Language and emotion voice synthesis with wavenet technology. Internet Of Things Internet Of Things By incorporating an in-built or cloud EPU instance, it is possible to make all e-Readers and personal assistants emotionally intelligent. This innovation would mean that they will be able to read a story aloud and completely understand the meaning of what they say. While listening to the voice of the device, the users will be able to understand how the device feels scared when the story gets scary or happy when the story is about something wonderful. They will remember what makes the users happy or unhappy, and act accordingly. KNOW MORE ABOUT IOT Self Driving Car Self Driving Car The days are not very far when your living experience while traveling in the car will become the selling point of the self driving cars. Increasing trust in autonomous vehicle Emotion and personality will play a central role in creating sentient cars (ExoCar). KNOW MORE ABOUT SDC AI & Chatbots AI & Chatbots The cloud EPU from Emoshape will pave the way for the next generation of NLG, commonly referred to as Natural Language Generation. In this NLU system, the agent determines a thought or intent, and builds a meaningful response dynamically by putting different words together. Therefore, the emotional state of the EPU can be considered to be a property or reward function that gets transferred to a NLG system, leading to the generation of Augmented Emotion Synthesis Language (ES Markup) and emotion neural voice synthesis. KNOW MORE ABOUT AI Personal Robotics Personal Robotics EPU stands apart in the industry not only by virtue of the fact that it is capable of understanding and generating any emotional state. This technology also allows a robot toy to develop a completely unique personality based on its user interactions, which will ultimately mean that no two have the exactly the same personality. The chip is able to control the different facial expressions and body languages of a robot without hard coded predicates.

KNOW MORE ABOUT VC The EPU Increase Customer Loyalty and Worker Productivity in Smart Buildings A microchip that enables an emotional response in Corporate Affective agents. Forrester analyzed CX Index data to see which of the three dimensions of CX quality matters most to customer loyalty effectiveness, ease, or emotion. They found that emotion, how an experience makes the customer feel, has a bigger influence on their loyalty to a brand than either of the other two factors. Repeating that analysis with data from the first wave of 2015 CX Index only strengthened that conclusion. Emotion was the #1 factor in customer loyalty across 17 of the 18 industries. Did you know, the happiest employees are 180% more energized than their less content colleagues, 155% happier with their jobs, 150% happier with life, 108% more engaged and 50% more motivated. Most staggeringly, they are 50% more productive too. We have developed a technology that could help you to make your customers more loyal. Intelligent agent able to sense the world can connect to social media like Twitter, Facebook, news feed, etc. or even your customer support software. Giving you unprecedented insight in real time about how your customers and employees feel about your company . Cloud Solution - SaaS Emoshape is pleased to reveal that their groundbreaking Emotion Processing Unit, popularly known as the EPU, has just got better and smarter with the introduction of cloud service (SaaS) . Following the upcoming release of EPU 3, the emotion processing chip will be accessible from the cloud via EPU s servers. The latest version of Emotion Processing Unit, EPU 3will bring about several new capabilities, and is scheduled hit the production floor in mid 2019.

EPU III is the industry s first emotion synthesis engine. It delivers high-performance machine emotion awareness, the EPU III family of eMCU are transforming the capabilities of Robots and AI. Emoshape has completed the production of the first EPU (emotional processing unit); a patent pending technology which creates emotional states and synthetic emotion in intelligent machines. The EPU is based on Patrick Levy-Rosenthal s Psychobiotic Evolutionary Theory extending the Ekman s theory by using not only twelve primary emotions identified in the psycho-evolutionary theory but also pain / pleasure and frustration / satisfaction. The groundbreaking EPU algorithms effectively enable machines to respond to stimuli in line with one of the twelve primary emotions: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, indifference, regret, surprise, inattention, trust, confidence, desire and joy. The Emotion recognition classifiers achieve more than 86 percent accuracy (ISEAR) on conversation. Read more The most innovative aspect of Emoshape microcontroller breakthrough is its real-time appraisal computation with reinforcement learning and Emotion Profile Graph (EPG) computation functionality allowing the AI or robot to experience 64 trillion possible distinct emotional states . Emotional stimuli is stored within the memory bank with its associated cognitive and physical state. The EPU II has developed an EPG, which is used to register and develop over time a bank of emotional associations for each memory data within each intelligent machine. The EPG can communicate the data to other AI technologies to achieve a realistic range of expressions and interactions designed specifically for the user. The data allows the AI technologies to virtually understand/get to know the user and elicit the same emotional response in kind. This technology allows an AI, robotic toy or an IoT device to develop a completely unique personality based on it s user interactions which will ultimately mean that no two have the exact same personality. Our emotion machine-learning cloud platform working together with the EPU is built on years of research, and becomes more emotionally intelligent with each interaction by symbolic reinforcement learning. The EPU represents a significant advance for AI, particularly for smartphones, toys, robots, android, computers, and other major electronic devices. This is the first time that the science and technology industry has empowered machines with emotion synthesis to respond and connect with human emotions, which is set to deliver an as yet undiscovered level of user experience between people and emotionally-enabled technology.

"Skip to content Darmiyan Menu expanded collapsed Team Padideh Kaveh Thomas Hesaam Elham Pavan Mohsen Ilyse Technology Partners News Hiring Home Darmiyan Early detection & monitoring of Alzheimer s disease through BrainSee TM The Virtual Microscope A Nobel Laureate approved technology Darmiyan is developing a commercial diagnostic software platform for the early detection, monitoring and stratification of Alzheimer s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders through an innovative magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis technology. Based on over 40 years of cutting-edge brain research, our technology can precisely quantify and detect changes in brain tissue at the cellular level in every voxel (3D pixel) of a brain MRI scan. Product Our novel solution, BrainSee TM , is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform. Doctors provide standard clinical brain MRI scans (T1, T2 FLAIR, and DWI/DTI), and BrainSee analyzes the scans in a few hours and provides detailed brain maps with exact quantification of neurodegeneration in each voxel, as well as a summary score that reflects the person s brain health and the likelihood of future cognitive decline. Why use BrainSee instead of PET or CSF biomarkers? Unlike MRI machines, PET (positron emission tomography) scanners are not widely available around the world. Performing an amyloid PET scan requires injection of a very expensive radioactive tracer and involves X-Ray radiation similar to a CT (computed tomography) scan. Moreover, amyloid-beta protein is a non-specific biomarker and not very accurate in determining the prognosis of MCI. CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) sampling requires lumbar puncture, an invasive and very inconvenient procedure. Unlike PET or CSF, Darmiyan s BrainSee solution is non-invasive, convenient, accurate, affordable, globally available, and scalable.

"Home Team Blog Contact Us Get Started Autonomous Application Performance Management Ensure Business Agility by Mitigating Kubernetes Downtime Email Email * Request a Demo $10K/min revenue loss due to app degradation 10% bounce rate per second of app delay 25% of engineering time spent on incidents Our contextual AI software mitigates cascading failure risks with minimal operational overhead. Distributed systems like Kubernetes are inherently prone to cascading failures. 
 Our contextual AI software reduces monitoring and troubleshooting overhead for cascading failures. 
 It relieves engineers from health rule maintenance, alarm fatigue, and brute-force debugging. 
 Our AI software uses unsupervised anomaly detection for streaming data, dynamic alarm ranking, and 
 time-series correlation ranking for causality detection. Unified Anomaly Monitoring to Minimize Monitoring Overhead Traditional health rule-based failure detection is increasingly losing efficacy in
 detecting cascading failure risks in distributed systems with thousands of metrics. 
 Our unsupervised real-time anomaly detection algorithm eliminates the need for health rules. 
 Our algorithm can handle irregular spikes and complex seasonalities. It can accept high-level
 user feedback for rapid anomaly baseline tuning. Dynamic Alarm Ranking to Minimize Alarm Fatigue A cascading failure, by its nature, produces an alarm flood. Our dynamic ranking algorithm 
 sorts alarms based on underlying anomaly concurrencies to assist software engineers cope with 
 alarm fatigue. Our algorithm is designed to scale for 10,000+ alarms with
 near real-time responsiveness. It can accept high-level user feedback for rapid tuning of ranking. Time-Series Correlation Ranking to Minimize Troubleshooting Overhead Asynchronous event flow in a distributed system makes root cause analysis hard. 
 Our time-series correlation ranking assists software engineers in root cause analysis
 by rapidly identifying the underlying causal factors. Our
 algorithm is designed to handle related operational issues such as phase shift, scale variance, and spuriousness.
 Moreover, it can accept high-level user feedback for rapid tuning of ranking. Demo Quicklinks Home Team Blog Contact Us Get Started Contact Us AdeptDC, Inc 995 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94103 Email Us: [email protected] Call Us: +1-833-233-7832. Our

We combine natural plants with modern technology and scientific knowledge to improve indoor air quality and energy efficiency. A selection of our customers Scientifically based plant concepts Find out how we improve the air quality in offices. For a larger office, Oxygen at Work brings nature into the office by combining scientific knowledge with an all-in-one service. Plants not only look great, they also make the air cleaner and create a pleasant working atmosphere. Many of us spend most of our time in stuffy offices. Is the concentration of harmful substances, e.g. CO2, too high in the air, can result in a lack of concentration and increased sick leave. Improving the air quality with plants is a more sustainable solution than doing this artificially using air conditioning technology. The right plants to control existing pollutants can improve air quality. Our work is based on intelligent data and current scientific studies. With the right plants, we can increase the O2 value and lower the CO2 concentration, save energy and ensure optimum air humidity in offices . Why are we doing this? Scientific studies show that crop plants can reduce disease outages by up to 60%. Plants offer a good opportunity to increase air humidity and thus reduce heating costs. Due to higher oxygen concentrations, 68% of employees feel fitter and less stressed With the help of intelligent data, energy consumption can be reduced by more than 40% Plants reduce CO2 emissions and allow you to reduce your CO2 footprint. Detailed and transparent reporting supports HVAC optimization. How it works Oxygen at Work in the media Feedback The Oxygen Gardens are popular and therefore always well staffed. Many colleagues really appreciate this retreat. Nicolas Gysi Head of Real Estate & Admin Services The difference was very noticeable, the whole atmosphere in the office is different due to the plants. Kai Ellerkmann Head of Controlling & Projects, CAR FOR YOU The decision to open our office was great! I believe that plants have a very big impact on our wellbeing.

It offers HIPAA-compliant data-sharing capabilities to healthcare providers , medical researchers , pharmaceutical companies and health insurers . PatientSphere For Patients For Providers For Payers For Pharma For Researchers PatientSphere enables patients to pull together data from electronic medical records, mobile health applications, wearable devices, chatbots, informatics programs like Apple HealthKit, Google Fit and other sources into one dashboard, where it remains secure and simple to navigate and share. Open Health Network has developed cloud-based middleware consisting of HIPAA-compliant distributed database that stores patient health data, patient identity management layer powered by blockchain. A metadata layer can be used to publish identified information and can be searched by entities such as pharmaceutical companies looking for clinical trials among others. Such data is in demand from medical researchers and pharma companies seeking out participants for clinical trials, health insurance and healthcare providers to increase adherence to treatments and more. Health systems can use PatientSphere to design patient experiences aimed at helping patients adhere to courses of treatment, learn about their health, track medications or give consent for certain information to be shared among providers. Health insurers can use the platform to incentivize healthy behaviors among their members, and researchers and pharmaceutical companies can create modules aimed at finding participants in clinical trials and increase adherence and retention rates. Request a Demo Partners & Customers OHN Platform in Action My Cardiac Coach App Lung Cancer Foundation App Medication Adherence Chatbot Nutromatic Chatbot OHN in the Press PatientSphere uses AI and blockchain to personalize treatment plans Find Out More Managing your healthcare data through the blockchain Find Out More AR Experience Integration Find Out More Sample Modules in OHN platform Chatbot Any type of chatbot can be rapidly developed on OHN chatbot platform. Conversations with patients can be captured and integrated into EMR/EHR if needed. Medication Adherence Medication Adherence module enables patients to configure reminders to refill and take their medications. Medications can be added by patients, caregivers or nurses. Escalation messages can be setup if system determines that patients are not taking their medications as prescribed. Patient Diary A Diary screen asks patients to report how they feel daily, gathering data on diet, appetite, physical activity, sleep, and other relevant variables. Customizable and Personalized Surveys Create any type of advanced surveys; immediately deploy them and maintain them using OHN's content management tool. Social Network Social Network serves highly relevant content for patients, filtered by specific disease, symptoms and treatments. Social features are designed to draw patients into an interactive experience, enable peer-to-peer support and patient engagement, increasing the likelihood that patients use the application consistently over longer periods of time. Alexa & Siri Voice Services Conversations with patients can be done via voice: medications reminders; surveys; appointment reminders; etc Analytics Whether tracking growth in users over time or allowing an individual user to see their self-reported levels of physical activity by month, OHN offers a wealth of visual data representation options that let both organizations and individuals see and respond to patterns and trends at a glance. Gamification Gamification features (badges, social support and notifications) prompt patients to come back to the Diary screen frequently. An Activity/Questionnaire feature serves patients a battery of questions specific to their conditions and symptoms, as well as questions on lifestyle, diet, socioeconomic stressors and other data points that may be determinants or risk factors of their disease. As questionnaires of this kind can often be long and tedious, resulting in low completion rates, our version of the questionnaire is broken into groups of questions that can be answered in any order, at any time. Questions are also presented in a way that can be answered in a few taps. Gamification features drive users to return to the questionnaire and, over time, fill in missing information. Customization and Expandability Open Health Network s platform can be customized to fit any patient-centered data collection requirements. Organizations can change the look and feel of the platform to reflect their own branding and customize content based on a specific disease or condition without the need for coding. To provide a richer user experience, OHN also allows for integration with third party sensors and/or wearable tech such as FitBit, Nike+ FuelBand, Withings scales and blood pressure monitors or diet tracking apps such as MyFitnessPal. Care Team Management Create user profiles; assign roles to control data access. Open Health Network implements cutting-edge AI algorithms and Big Data Analytics algorithms to enhance its healthcare products. Front end OHN creates real-time analytics integrated with its mobile application platform that enable critical insights into how patients use mobile applications, what works and what does not. The user insights are correlated with health outcomes, and predictive models are constructed to link app usage behavior to real-world behavior change required for disease management and prevention. Back end OHN maintains a comprehensive HIPAA-compliant data warehouse for all data [active and passive] generated by app users. Data can be exported to EMRs, research systems such as RedCap and SAS, CDISC schema, or using custom ETL processes. OHN conducts custom on-site analysis of the data using Hadoop, Spark and and leading tools in statistical computing, and presents results via easy-to-use real-time interactive dashboards and regular reports. Platform independent OHN integrates data generated by application users with the universe of publicly and privately available datasets, including U.S. Census bureau socio-economic data, Medicare data, EPA environmental pollution data, location and mobility patterns from Uber, and social media data. Resulting datasets enrich our understanding of health and disease and provide insights on potential future interventions. Example #1 OHN helped large pharma company understand how changes in the Medicare Part D legislation affect users of their drugs. To do so, OHN used public data on over 4 million Medicare claims to develop a statistical model of likely patients, their disease progression and likely future prescriptions. This allows pharma company to better structure their offerings and insurance formularies in specific disease states and increase their market share over competing drugs. Example #2 OHN has developed machine learning models to recognize symptoms and adverse events in social media and open text data enabling new ways of monitoring drug performance in the real world. Example #3 OHN has implemented an agent-based model of incidence of colon cancer and implications of policy interventions, enabling policy analysis of early screenings and interventions. The model is being extended to cover other disease states including heart disease and diabetes. Example #4 OHN has extensive experience with other AI techniques, including recommendation engines, rule-based and case-based reasoning systems, support vector machines, and natural language processing.

Due to the design the easily fit in the helmet and it heavily reduces the sound of wind and motorbike (which can be helpful especially during long rides) while still being able to drive safely through traffic! love it! Loop Earplugs Share | Facebook Twitter Was this review helpful? 55 12 A 12/04/2018 Anonymous Belgium Comfortable and effective I used the Loop's during a concert and during band rehearsal.
They are easy to put in yourear and, more importantly, to pull them out as well. :-)

The filtering is effective for a concert.
For band rehearsal, the filtering is a bit too much.

Is it possible to have a version of the Loop's that filters less? Loop Earplugs Share | Facebook Twitter Was this review helpful? 44 8 NF 03/29/2019 Nicol s F.

Ils sont super agr ables (pas de d mangeaisons avec ceux en silicone (?)) et efficaces. Vous devriez sp cifier sur votre site (si ce n'est pas d j fait) que les bouchons sont adaptables selon la taille du conduit auditif (3 tailles) et que vous proposez 2 mati res (silicone? ou mousse) de bouchons. C' tait vraiment une belle surprise de pouvoir choisir la mati re et la taille qui me convenaient le mieux. Bonne continuation. Loop Earplugs Share | Facebook Twitter Was this review helpful? 25 6 VB 12/27/2018 Veerle B. Belgium Finally found my match! As a big fan of music, concerts, the occasional party, and sadly with lessons learnt after damage to my ears, I was since long looking for the proper ear protection. Until now, using the standard foam or wax plugs, which always had me fumbling my ears throughout the entire event! Those days are gone! Loop is my perfect match in protection, ease of use, comfort AND style! Moreover, proud to wear them as a complementary accessory to my party wear. And I can be worry-free about my ears!! I advise them to everyone .

Product Benefits Features Contact Us Get Free Trial The right prices to hit your targets Take your pricing and marketing decisions with confidence on impacts Watch video insights Understand market and customers dynamics actions Take pricing and marketing decisions with confidence results Realise commercial targets through optimized pricing actions Our approach Benefits Why dynamic pricing. Pricing should be desumed. Not imposed. Fixed pricing does not cope with increasing market volatility and tend to become inefficient. Dynamic pricing allows to significantly reduce the gap between static offer and mutable demand. Markets are continuous. Not discrete. One-off analyses become obsolete as soon as conditions change. Data-driven approach allows to sense and to address market moods in real-time. Focus on commercial targets. Prices will come. Increasing catalogue variety multiplies relationships among market variables. Smart systems are required to tame with complexity and keep pricing aligned to commercial targets. Features The Liquidprice multi-domain approach. Understand customers behaviour and get out the best from every SKU Benchmark your catalogue and evaluate price positioning Recognize key value items driving store performances Get evidence of price effectiveness for target accomplishment Get offeral recommendations to launch effective promotional campaigns Select commercial targets you want to accomplish Fix the right channel for product display Receive product recommendations with the right price Automate pricing processes by means of artificial intelligence Fix boundaries for AI engine optimisation Receive and apply pricing optimisation according to evolving market conditions Size the impact and monitor performance evolution Price better.

Get Your Free, No Obligation Quote My heating had failed on one of the coldest days of the year and I could only give Eco Nrg a 3 hour window to come and sort it out. They pulled out the stops and fixed it within the hour! Great service! Mr Fairbrass, Kingsbridge We contracted Eco Nrg to provide a Solaredge PV system to our new build house. Nick and his team could not be have been more helpful. The initial advice helped sort out the claims and counter claims made by so many of the other companies we contacted. The installation teams that attended the property over the different stages of the build were all very knowledgeable and co-operative working alongside the other contractors on site. I can without hesitation strongly recommend Eco Nrg. Mr Stewart, Portreath The two boys who came to do the work on your company s behalf were absolutely lovely. I don t give compliments easily. They were polite, clean, tidy, respectful and professional. They took the time to photograph their work and showed me the pictures which was a lovely touch! 
 
Normally I hate having workmen on site because it feels like my home is being invaded but your guys were an absolute pleasure to have around Ms Woodward, Bigbury We would like to thank you all for the friendly and efficient service we received recently during the installation of our solar panels. We are extremely pleased with them and would be happy to recommend them. We were also particularly pleased with the after care and contact. Mr and Mrs Farrow, Bristol We have been very pleased with the level of service that we have received from EcoNRG and with the quality of the solar panel installation. The two fitters that did the work were very efficient and tidy and they also planned their work around events that were happening in the hall and generally went the extra mile . Any subsequent queries that we had have been dealt with promptly. Mr Trout, Beaworthy Lastest From Eco nrg Our Blog Posts Our Latest Installations Services For almost a decade Eco Nrg Ltd. have been taking renewable energy projects from dreams to reality in Devon and across the South West of England. Our technical teams are experts in both initial installation and servicing across the domestic and commercial sectors, with experience across a huge range of renewable technologies and brands. Solar PV Panels Thanks to some of the highest sunlight levels in the UK, properties in the South West of England are perfectly positioned to benefit from a Solar PV Installation.

With low-cost solutions and rising electricity prices, there's no better way to provide your property with clean, green energy, and make a tremendous return on your investment.

Learn More About Solar Panels Air Source Heat Pumps Reliably supply up to 100% of your property's heating and hot water requirements, and lower your emissions with our Air Source Heat Pumps. Residents in the South West who are currently keeping their property warm with LPG, electricity or any other off-grid solution could see huge savings in their heating bills by making the switch to an Air Source Heat Pump, and thanks to generous government incentives, it could cost a lot less than you might think. Learn More About Heat Pumps Energy Storage Solutions Generating solar energy faster than you can use it? Make the most of the daylight by installing a battery storage solution that can run your property once the sun goes down, or import from the grid when prices are low.

Even better, thanks to government incentives, you can receive up to 500 towards the cost of your installation. Learn More About EV Chargers Solar System Upgrades Make sure that you're existing Solar PV system is running at peak performance with power optimisation technology that will maintain your investment for years. Basic systems will drop in efficiency to match the output of the lowest-performing panel, but with a SolarEdge upgrade, each panel can output individually, giving your system a huge efficiency boost, generating more electricity and saving you more money. Learn More About Solar Upgrades We're fully certified and trusted by the industry, so you know you'll be getting the best service possible Learn More About Our Accreditations 2010 YEAR ESTABLISHED 1200+ PROJECTS COMPLETED 12,000+ PANELS INSTALLED 10GWh OF ENERGY PRODUCED About Us We've been installing renewable technologies in the South West of England for almost a decade now, but it all started with one man who had a single goal in mind - get the UK going green. Our Technical Director, Nick Skelley, had been a trusted electrician in Devon and Cornwall for over 25 years, and believed that the future was in renewable technologies. Thanks to his demanding standards and the hard work of our experienced technicians, Eco Nrg Ltd. quickly became a name associated with quality, value for money and great customer service. Our commitment to quality is well recognised in the industry as well, with SunPower, the manufacturer of the most efficient solar panels in the world, naming Eco Nrg Ltd as a Sunpower Premier Partner. The technologies have changed rapidly over the years, but we've been hard at work to ensure that our customers always get the perfect system, from domestic installations to large commercial jobs, we're proud to help the UK go green. Learn More About us Why Go Green In The South West? Thanks to a mild climate and good weather conditions, the South West is a brilliant place to be if you're interested in renewable energy installations. It may not always seem like it, but down here in the South West of England, we regularly get more sunlight than most of the UK, and it's usually a much warmer place to live. This gives us the perfect climate for renewable technologies, and properties in the South West generally see greater yields from their renewable installations than our friends further up the line. This is because it's easier for a Heat Pump to keep a property warm when the surroundings are a little warmer (although they can work at temperatures as low as -15 C) and Solar PV Panels generate more electricity in sunny conditions. If you have a property in Plymouth, Exeter, Bristol, Truro or anywhere else in Devon or the South West of England, let's have a chat about just how much you could save by going green. Get Your Free, No Obligation Quote Frequent Questions How long does a Solar PV system take to pay itself off? A typical 4kWp south-facing system will pay itself back in 7 years - after that the system will generate pure profit. It can be a little longer for smaller systems or those at poorer orientations, but we can confirm your estimated payback time during your no-obligation site survey. Can my Solar PV panels provide hot water? With the use of a Smart Switch, any un-used electricity can be used to provide your home with free hot water. Is a Heat Pump right for me? Heat Pumps are most cost-effective for new build properties that are well insulated and make use of underfloor heating. But you can also see huge benefits in older, retrofit properties. If your Oil & LPG bills are high, you could save a huge amount with a well sized Heat Pump. To ensure you get the perfect system, we ll carry out a full heat loss survey throughout your property. Where do Eco Nrg Work? Eco NRG is based near Plymouth, in the South West of England. We mostly work across Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, having completed hundreds of installations in Plymouth, Exeter, Truro and Bristol. We do occasionally work a little further from home though, especially on larger commercial projects, so our best advice is simply to get in touch and we'll see if we're the right fit for you. How much does a Solar PV system cost? That depends on the size of the system you re after. Our smaller systems can be installed from as little as 3500, with our 4kWp systems starting at 4,500 (inc. VAT) How much can I generate from Solar Panels? A south-facing roof with a 4kWp solar system can generate over 4000 units (kWh) per year. On average, a household will use around 3200 units per year, so with a good system you can run your home completely free. Do Heat Pumps require a lot of maintenance? A properly installed Heat Pump requires next to no maintenance. We simply recommend an annual service to ensure that everything is running as expected. Do Heat Pumps provide my property with hot water? Our Heat Pumps will provide your property with all the hot water you need throughout the whole day What can I use a Tesla Powerwall for? There are a variety of applications for Powerwall. If you have a Solar PV system, you can store your excess generation during the day and use that energy to power your property at night. You can draw from the grid at times with a lower rate, and then use that energy during more expensive times to reduce your bill. You can even monitor your real-time energy usage with the Tesla mobile app. More Questions?

Lauren 04/04/2020 Eucalyptus Lyocell Sheet Sets Most awarding sheets ever During these rough times any kind of laughter brings joy to the heart... My sheets, eye shield bring me joy. Manning my sheltie decided to get a good night sleep last night as well...so this here is... priceless!!! Shauna Bertrand 04/03/2020 Sheets & Giggles Heaven here I come I slept with just the pillow cases first. My face was so happy. Today when I got home I switched the sheets on my bed. I jumped in for a quick try. Cannot wait for bedtime now. I know I won t be disappointed. Deb Portuese 04/02/2020 Eucalyptus Lyocell Sheet Sets My new favorite sheets Before I tried Sheets and Giggles my husband would only want to sleep on bamboo sheets. I liked the feel of our bamboo set but the top sheet wasn t long enough to make our bed and we don t have a deep mattress. Then we tried these and I LOVE my new eucalyptus sheets because they feel great, they re eco friendly and they are long enough to tuck in and stay tucked in even when we use our adjustable base. I am definitely buying a 2nd set. I can t say enough good things. Anna Vangel 04/01/2020 Eucalyptus Lyocell Sheet Sets Great sheets Very happy Erika 04/01/2020 Fitted Sheet Only Extra Deep Pockets The best sleep! These sheets feel like silk- only better. Thanks for a great product. Amy P 03/31/2020 Eucalyptus Lyocell Sheet Sets Best sheets on the PLANET! <3 <3 I honestly was very hesitant at the idea of spending over $100 on a set of sheets. I did my research though. Since Sheets & Giggles has a phenomenal return policy, I decided to give them a try. Luckily for me, the sheets exceeded my expectations 100 fold. I will not need to utilize their return policy. I went ahead and pre-ordered their comforter and will order another color of sheets in the near future. Don't hesitate! They will change your life! ****not a paid review**** Daniel Lung 03/31/2020 Eucalyptus Lyocell Sheet Sets Amazing These are the best sheets I've ever owned by a long shot.

I m ready to take this relationship to the next level and will definitely be ordering a set of sheets. Lois 03/31/2020 Extra Pillowcases (2) So soft! These sheets are so soft.

Margaret Finley 03/31/2020 Eucalyptus Lyocell Sheet Sets Came for the Conservation, Stayed for the Cuddles I was initially attracted to Sheets & Giggles as an environmentally-sound option for new bedsheets.

"Home Mission Team Partnership Technology News Contacts EARTH AI mission is to fundamentally improve the efficiency of mineral exploration to provide enough metals and minerals for the current and future generations. OUR MISSION Technology The demand for minerals is ever increasing. But with most of the world s surface mineral deposits already found, we need to be looking deeper to find the next generation of deposits.

Elsa Sze // Founder Team We are a bunch of millennials who feel under-voiced as employees, under-powered as citizens, and over-whelmed as information consumers. So we are taking what we learned from our previous lives at Google, Harvard, McKinsey, MIT, EdX, and the Obama campaign to reimagine human governance by changing the way we share ideas and make decisions.

Record performance on the glacier We are partners of Audi Nines and, together with Klarx, build extreme facilities for winter and summer sports events. In April 2019, we made machines available on the glacier in Hochgurgl to move a total of 200,000 cubic meters of snow for the snow park. Delivering machines at such heights means enormous logistical challenges that we were only able to master through our experience from numerous rental orders. The result is impressive: a new world record in the quarterpipe and many other great moves by athletes who loved the park. View all stories Turn old into new Proklima specializes in complex renovations of public buildings. The services of the experts from Nuremberg are therefore in demand across Germany. They often need demolition and special machines for their operations and have found a partner in us who reliably sets up every construction site. Regardless of whether it is a mobile excavator in Munich or a large crawler excavator with concrete scissors in Dortmund: Proklima machines bring new freshness to old buildings or make space for new buildings. ""At Klarx, we always get machines easily across Germany. Even when the market is empty, Klarx provides machines with which I am very satisfied."" Karsten K., Proklima Bau GmbH See all stories Record performance on the glacier ""This event has enormous technical challenges because we had to move a lot of 200,000 cubic meters of snow.

Why should I sell my minerals? From cashing out small portions to reduce the risk of your overall portfolio to handling complex situations where minerals are passed down from one generation to another, there are a variety of reasons for why you should sell your minerals. We term these as tax implications, commodity prices, overall diversity of personal wealth and/ or concentration risk, and inheritance issues. Talk to us to understand how these could affect you. 2. Can I sell a portion of my interest? YES! You can choose to sell a portion of your royalties. This way, you can get some cash for the portion of the interest you sold right away while still receiving the monthly income from the portion of your royalties. 3. What is a ""Net Mineral Acre"" vs a ""Net Royalty Acre""? A net mineral acre (NMA) is a measure that indicates the acres of minerals you have. A net royalty acre (NRA) is a rate that indicates how much you can receive from your NMA. NRA takes into account the royalty burden on each mineral. An NRA calculation is arrived at through a few different calculations, all of which are correct in their own way. The equation to get to an NRA is: 4. Why does my monthly royalty check vary? There are a lot of reasons behind this. The two most common ones are: 1. Fluctuations in oil and gas prices: Since your royalty check depends directly on this, your royalty checks will vary from month to month as well. 2. Production: Production can be inconsistent as the output a well produces can vary from one month to another . If you had a high volume of output this month, you would receive a high amount in your royalty check. If you have a low output the next, you would receive a lower amount. Talk to us to understand more about this. 5. What is earnest money? Earnest money also referred to as escrow money is a sum of money a seller should give you when making an offer. If they don t offer any such payments, chances are they don t intend to buy from you. Think of it as the down payment on a home you wish to buy. When a seller doesn t offer you earnest money, they are free to walk away without any financial repercussions if they decide not to close the deal with you. At Revere Resources, we offer 10% of the final purchase price as earnest money. 6. How do you value my minerals if the future is so uncertain and full of so many risks? We have enlisted the help of unbiased 3rd party reservoir engineers to put a proper value on your asset. These experts also determine how quickly the producing wells are losing value and if your asset has any other wells which might be drillable. This means that we give you credit even for undrilled wells. Because we have your best interest at heart.

We would be happy to help Contact Us We treat each seller like a long-term partner, whether you're selling us 1 acre or 20,000 acres. After all, we're mineral owners too.

 Paying reimbursements, says Hecker. The greater the trading volume, the higher the respective remuneration
 to the broker. This means that the IT infrastructure and Fintech staff are currently only 25
 Employees insist on paying. Many providers in Germany advertise free deposit fees . Because the devil
 As is known to be in the details, many of these providers hide the actual costs entirely
 elsewhere and not infrequently in the order fees, i.e. in the costs incurred with a
 Trade transaction. For example, if you have 1000 euros per month with an average
 Deposit volume of 10,000 euros, if you want to create your order via the Internet, you have to contact the broker
 Degiro, calculated for the year, only pay around 45.20 euros, while with the Comdirect 228 euros. How come
 there are such big differences, and which custodian bank is the best for investors? First of all, there is not one best custodian bank for every investor. Depending on the investment behavior
 For example, many small sums or rather seldom large sums can be invested differently
 Custodians will be attractive. Those who trade less frequently and with smaller sums can do so depending on
 Handelsgr e offer a provider with a lower commission fee if this is only 0.026 or 0.1 percent
 be. However, if the trading volume per order increases, brokers recommending a flat rate on the
 Offer trading volumes like Onvista Bank or Flatex, which in principle do not charge commission
 demand, but only 5 and 5.90 euros per trade order. In addition, not every broker offers one
 regular savings plan. Degiro and Lynx are among the cheaper providers, but do not offer any
 Savings plans on funds or ETFs. Trade Republic does not currently offer any savings plans. But it is planned, says
 Hecker. Another reason for the fee differences are the costs that brokers incur and then the
 reflected in the supplier's order fees. These arise at different providers
 Bodies: For example, through trading on the stock exchanges and through the clearing houses that trade
 process, as well as by personnel and the maintenance of the required IT systems. The more automated the
 Process, the lower the costs are often. This becomes particularly noticeable, depending on whether the order is online
 be it on the computer or on the cell phone or whether investors call their broker for their order
 want. For example, if you want to place a trade order over the phone or in person, you have to
 expect significantly higher costs . You could also compare it a bit with airlines: Who
 expecting a more personal service has to dig deeper in the end. Sometimes this explains
 not why there are large differences in the fee regulation for many online brokers. Jan Jirsa, regional director of Degiro for the German-speaking region, said in an interview with FAZ.NET that
 many large banks would buy their IT systems externally, which would be more expensive. In contrast, younger companies would have
 Advantage that you would have built your own IT systems. However, he added that the stock exchange trading
 is basically not free. Hecker, who himself spent a few years for one, also sees the outdated IT systems of many major banks
 Investment bank has been the biggest problem for the high cost of many brokers. These are
 some systems from the seventies, says Hecker. There, however, there is great potential for savings. At the end
 the customers would bear the extra costs. The three founders who look beyond the industry’s high
 Fees, at the beginning, had also played with the idea of cooperating with another bank.
 In the end, however, it was the most sensible way to found a bank yourself and the IT system from scratch
 build up. Trade Republic wants to open its digital gates to its customers step by step in order to do that
 Not putting too much strain on the system and eliminating possible teething problems, says Hecker. IT likes
 then be new, but whether it is as robust as many established brokers has yet to be proven. With the smartphone to the B rse Handelsblatt, January 23, 2019 https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/digitaler-broker-start-up-trade-republic-per-smartphone-an-den-aktienmarkt /23895122.html The start-up Trade Republic wants to trade securities with an app easier and cheaper
 make and relies on established partners. Christian Hecker has a clear goal: he wants investors to start trading in securities
 facilitate. To this end, he founded the Trade Republic company with two friends from Munich
 he describes himself as ""Germany's first mobile and commission-free broker"". The technology behind it
 have already tested the founders as part of an exchange game called ""Neon Trading"" . To the legal
 They have gained partners to meet the requirements: the financial service providers Sino and Solarisbank. In front
 Trade Republic also received a license as a securities trading bank from the financial regulator Bafin for one month.
 Thanks to the smartphone app, the start-up should appeal to younger users in particular. The cheap fees could
 but also attract experienced investors. Hecker and his co-founders are based on financial technology start-ups such as the smartphone bank N26
 Berlin. Such fintechs choose individual banking products and make them easier and more convenient for customers
 often cheaper. This seems to work for N26: with their modern checking account, which
 and insurance products from partners, the young bank claims to have within
 2.3 million customers in 24 countries over four years. Trade Republic does not offer a completely new product either, but it is of great value during development
 Ease of use: ""Our app is very intuitive, the user always has his portfolio everywhere
 Look, and we also offer a comprehensive depot service, ""says the 29-year-old founder
 Features include free real-time data and a price alert that is triggered as soon as a security hits you
 has reached the previously set course. The new broker also has a role model in the pricing model: the fintech already offers robinhood in the USA
 free share trading since 2014. At Trade Republic, investors should have one euro per trade
 so-called third-party lump sum payments - regardless of the size of the order. A commission requires trade
 Republic does not, but lives from a small refund of the LS Exchange platform
 Financial service provider Lang and Schwarz, through which the trade runs. According to Hecker, this is possible thanks to less
 Infrastructure costs: ""We have built our own securities trading bank and technology and
 therefore work very efficiently. ""Other providers charge significantly higher prices. FMH-Finanzberatung has that
 Recently 18 online brokers compared and shown: Who runs a deposit with an average of 35,000 euros in assets
 and places an order of an average of 2,500 euros each 16 times a year, pays per trade

"Home Solution Industries Demo Blog About Us Jobs Contact Go Synthetic! for Big Data Privacy Unlock your big data assets, while keeping individuals' privacy completely safe & secure. LEARN MORE The Synthetic Data Revolution Advances in machine learning enable simulating synthetic populations, that resemble the characteristics as well as diversity of actual people. For the first time, rich personal data assets become available at scale for many industries, that can be freely processed, analyzed and shared further. Finally, big data & privacy protection are both possible! The World's Most Advanced Synthetic Data Engine Mostly AI has developed a game-changing new technology for synthetic data generation, resulting in a uniquely powerful product. Mostly GENERATE enables you to generate an unlimited number of highly realistic & representative synthetic customers, matching the patterns and behaviors of your actual customers at an unprecedented level. As synthetic data is anonymous and exempt from data protection regulations, this opens up a whole range of opportunities for your otherwise locked-up data, resulting in faster innovation, less risks and less costs. SEE Mostly Generate Companies That Trust Us Use Cases The accuracy of our Synthetic Data Engine goes far beyond what is known as mockup or dummy data. It enables you to share highly accurate, yet anonymous data at scale, with a broad range of internal as well as external partners, without putting your customers' privacy or your reputation at risk. AI Training & Analytics Advanced analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence require broad data access, and new emerging tools & infra. Provide data at scale and with peace of mind in non-prod environments to your data scientists and AI engineers alike. Open Big Data & Innovation Data is the new oil. So, fuel your innovation by broadly sharing granular level data with researchers , startups and innovators alike, increasing the chances for disrupting breakthroughs. Testing & Development Accelerate the development, testing and integration of your next-generation, data-driven products and services by providing as-good-as-real data to your developers and testers . Data Monetization Share your data assets without putting privacy at risk, either directly or via data marketplaces . Synthetic data can be offered at its fullest detail, and thus delivers much higher value compared to existing anonymization techniques . Customer Centricity Restricting data access to a handful of engineers prohibits broader customer understanding. Establish a modern data-driven culture by openly sharing representative data at all levels to boost customer-centricity. User Experience Design Digital products only come to life with data. Thus, it is pivotal to provision highly realistic data, in all its diversity, to product owners and designers in order to deliver an intuitive, relevant user experience to your customers. Vendor Validation A range of SaaS providers offer compelling new solutions, but require data to be ingested for test-driving their services under realistic conditions. Provide synthetic in lieu of actual data to safely experience these new offerings in action. Open APIs Enable external developers to build upon your existing customer base by adding additional data-driven services. Developing these will require, aside from well designed APIs, also the provisioning of realistic data to prototype against. The Underestimated Risk of Masking Masking or obfuscating of only a few data points, while leaving everything else intact, does not protect against de-anonymization .

Being able to tailor the nutrition to our specific needs, as high-level pro athletes, is incredible. Rex. R. | Pro Cyclist It's really hard to find a good recovery shake that's organic and also vegan. It's a hard thing to get it right and not have it taste like dirt. With most high-quality formulas, you feel like you need to close your nose and plug. With kyoku, I can sip on it and enjoy. Rendy W. | Triathlete I think it's important to be conscious about nutrition and what you put in your body because you are what you eat and the quality and source of those ingredients play a source in that. It's also important to consider the environmental consequences behind your nutrition choices. I appreciate kyoku's emphasis on environmental sustainability and quality. Misha R. | Cyclist Nutrition is a huge part of training. You have the stimulus, the training itself, but then you have the recovery. The training breaks down the body and makes you weaker and the recovery is what makes you strong. For Semper Porro to be strong and fit and be able to outwork and out-train the competitors, we need to be very focused on the recovery process. Innokenty Z. | Pro Cyclist I really believe in whole foods and that we are what we eat. Organics is a huge part of my philosophy with foods. Having as many local, fresh, and organic ingredients as possible is a requirement for me. Kyoku makes it easy for me to consume what I need without compromise.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

Your username on Afternic can be any name of your own choosing, and identifies you as Standard Member or AfternicDLS Member. Prospective counterparties will be able to view your member profile, post comments about you, and view the auctions you are involved in, but in no way will have access to your true identity or your email address. Our Site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. You can request the removal of your personally identifiable information from our blog or community forum, by contacting us at privacy@afternic.com .

"TAKEOFF FLIGHT PLAN THE CREW PARTNERS NEWS MEDIA CAREERS CONTACT TAKEOFF FLIGHT PLAN THE CREW PARTNERS NEWS MEDIA CAREERS CONTACT Scroll Ampaire takes flight with the highest capacity electric aircraft ever flown. Our mission is to be the world s most trusted developer of practical, compelling electric aircraft. Ampaire is making flying more accessible to more people from more airports by developing electric aircraft that are less costly, safe, clean, and quiet. While others are still in development, we re in the air. We have an electric hybrid plane in the air now. We have the tech now. We will be certified years ahead of our competition. We will be first to enter commercial production. We will be first to enter into commercial service. There s nothing wrong with blue skying it. As long as you re actually up there when you re doing it. People are taking notice. Ampaire is winning international awards, we're backed by the world's top startup networks in our industry, we have government contracts for research and development, and we re working closely with the FAA. The Third Revolution in Aviation has begun. And it s going to be electric. Electric aircraft vs. fossil fuel aircraft: The opportunity is huge. Switching to electric expands the number of viable destinations by ten times - from 500 to 5000 airports in the U.S. alone. Similar expansion can happen all across the globe. People from smaller towns will no longer have to endure long hours on the road to their destinations or to an airport to get to a meeting, a hospital, or to grandma s. Regional airlines will thank us. Regional airlines struggling to be profitable due to high operating costs and those that only survive thanks to government subsidies will once again thrive. And so will our planet. We can finally put an end to the commercial airline industry dumping 800 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each year. In California alone, small aircraft emit 70,000 pounds of lead, 1,700 tons of NOx , 90,000 pounds of particulate matter annually. Our heads may be in the clouds, but our feet are on the ground. Our Flight Plan Our pragmatic, step-by-step, scalable plan gives us the fastest, leanest pathway to quiet, clean, safe, reliable, affordable commercial electric aircraft in the shortest time possible. It s the leanest, fastest, most capital efficient approach to making commercial electric air travel a reality. And it starts with retrofits. We are transforming existing passenger planes to electric. Our first twin-engine plane has a combustion engine in the nose and an electric engine in the tail, providing redundancy and improved levels of safety. THE FLIGHT CREW Our mission is to be the world s most trusted developer of practical, compelling electric aircraft. And we ve built the team to get it done. The Ampaire team brings expertise from top institutions across the electric vehicle and aerospace industries and includes former executives from Boeing and GM s EV Division. Sharing our Airspace The airlines we work with aren t just our customers, they re our collaborators. We re right there with them in the copilot seat. We're flying in their planes and talking with their leadership, their pilots, their maintenance crews and their customers. Ampaire has LOIs from regional airlines around the globe. And we've partnered with Mokulele Airlines in Hawaii to fly our retrofitted planes on their routes - the world's first operational demonstration of electrified aircraft by a commercial operator.

Unlike an la carte system, we truly believe that a full-service management solution is the only way to guarantee quality across the board. By getting to know your property inside and out, we're able to handle any and all issues that may arise during your rentals. If I don't have an Airbnb account, what should I do? If you don't have an Airbnb account, no problem, we'll be happy to sign up for you. Where will my listings be posted ? We use the most established short-term rental platform: Airbnb. It is the most popular listing website, generating more bookings than all the others. How much could I earn? It s hard to say without knowing all the features of your home. But we can assure you our target is not just to take away the hassle of hosting, it's to help you earn more as well. We prepare your listings with care , and adjust your prices dynamically. This means that the price of your apartment rental will be adapted according to different criteria (day of the week, occupancy of neighbouring properties, past prices, local events) with the aim of achieving the best price possible . Who uses Luckey? Luckey was built for people with property that's left unoccupied all or part of the year . Accomodations must be well-located and fulfill the requirements of a short-term rental by being in good condition, compliant with current regulations, and fully equipped and furnished. Entrust us with your property and we'll provide you with a simple solution, a sure and steady income and, above all, peace of mind . How do you choose my potential guests? We are extremely careful when selecting guests. On Airbnb, we check if your future guests have been well-reviewed . Each guest is required to deposit a down payment for their stay . Can I still use my Airbnb account? Unfortunately, a user can only have one single account on Airbnb and we'll have to create an account at your name to manage your property on the platform, so you won't be able to keep using your existing account as a guest... We are working closely with Airbnb to find a solution to this issue. Who takes the photos for my property listings? We use professional photographers to ensure the photos are the highest possible quality. This makes for a more attractive listing and a higher occupancy rate . What languages will my listings be posted in? Your listings will be posted in both French and English on Airbnb. How do you decide my property rental fee? Your property rental fee depends on its size, location, and availability. With our expertise and experience , we aim to determine the right price. Why do my property rental rates vary over the course of the year? We've developed our own pricing adjustment system. Based on yield management strategies, rental rates are updated daily according to the season, occupancy rates, and local events. We'll decide together on the minimum rate you want to set for your property when we adjust prices. But it's important to understand that lowering rent in the off-season allows you to boost your property's occupancy rate , which is why we encourage you to trust us. Who manages my reservations? How? Managing reservations and requests for information can be a time-consuming and arduous task, but not for us. We allow you to easily follow and manage your bookings with a simple phone app. And above all, we have a dedicated and efficient team available 24/7 to guests . Can I access my Airbnb account to view my reservations? As long as we're managing your rental property, we'll be the only ones with access to your Airbnb account. But you can easily track your reservations, under the Bookings tab in your Luckey app . Can I access my property when there is a guest there? To ensure that your guests have a unique and unforgettable stay , you should not enter your property without first providing advance notice to your guests. You can block any dates you want access your home on your calendar via the Properties tab in the Luckey app . What happens when guests cancel their reservation? The reimbursement amount granted to guests who cancel their reservation varies according to the cancellation policy chosen. We adjust your rental rates according to the season, occupancy rates and local events, and do our utmost to offer you the best cancellation policy for your needs. What are the risks involved in a short-term rental? As there is a relatively high turnover in tenants, furnishings and equipment are obviously subject to greater wear and tear. Tourists or visitors who are just passing through tend to be less attentive to personal property than tenants who rent on a yearly basis. Vacation rentals require a higher level of personal property maintenance , which can lead to some additional costs. How does Luckey minimize risks? We minimize risks by carefully screening our guests. Our house cleaning staff, who come by after your guests leave, inform us of any anomalies in your home so we can step in without delay . Who takes care of welcoming guests? Our friendly, bilingual (FR-EN) Luckey Welcomers are carefully selected by our team to welcome your guests . We work with a mobile app that allows for easy communication with each of our Welcomers and provides them with all the information they may need. What is included in the cleaning service? We take the quality of our house cleaning services very seriously. They are handled by a company selected with care. The cleaning staff are all professionals ; their services include an in-depth cleaning of the apartment and providing good quality sheets, towels, vanity kits, and slippers. What is the claim compensation process? Airbnb has a well-established dispute settlement procedure . It gathers the evidence that could be useful as quickly as possible: photos, bills, police reports and other documents attesting to the property, damages incurred and the fair market value of the damaged goods. As soon as Airbnb has gathered sufficient information from the two parties, it reviews all documents and assesses the compensation claims. We do our utmost to gather evidence within the very short timelines provided, but Airbnb remains the sole judge, and Luckey cannot be held responsible for any decision not in your favor.

"Home Technology Applications Mobility Other Applications Company News Contact Français Select a page For a centralized hydrogen production solution L Hydrog does not appear today as the key vector of the energy transition, as it to integrate both energy sources and uses. In this context, its ramp-up requires the development of competitive and centralized solutions for the production, storage and distribution of hydrogen. The current solutions for production, storage and distribution of hydrog do not remain complex and involve various means of electrolysis, mechanical compression, storage, which do not make it possible to meet expectations effectively. This is why the ERGOSUP company has chosen to embark on this ambitious challenge by developing an innovative solution for supplying centralized hydrogen, incorporating, in addition to the production function, additional storage functions (without hydrog pressurized), compression (electrochemical), and energy return. This electrolysis technology based on zinc electrochemistry, the winner of the world innovation competition, is distinguished by a coupling over time of the oxygen and gaseous hydrogen releases. The fields of application are hydrogen distribution stations for carbon mobility and energy conversion / storage systems for stationary needs. Our company ERGOSUP, a start-up established in Dr me, is developing an innovative process for the storage and conversion of electricity into hydrogen under pressure. The target markets are the supply of carbon hydrogen for industrial applications, for hydrogen filling stations, as well as for mass stationary energy storage solutions.

Learn More MOTIVE Command Center 24 hours 7 days a week 365 days a year Supporting the deployed Guidance Systems and providing directional drilling advice (469) 729-6489 Faqs There are a number of directional drilling downhole tools, surface systems, and service providers. Are there any restrictions with compatibility? No Restrictions in compatibility have arisen thus far. Directional drillers from over a dozen different directional drilling companies have successfully guided wells with advice from the MOTIVE Bit Guidance System, and many of them have set performance records with the first use of the system. To further facilitate operational effectiveness and compatibility, MOTIVE provides onsite training to directional drillers or rig drillers on the use of the Bit Guidance System. Why does the industry need a Bit Guidance System? Directional drilling control technology has been lagging behind other technical advances that led to the tremendous growth in horizontal drilling in North American shale plays. The most significant directional drilling problem identified has been the inability to consistently follow a prescribed well path and to hit and stay within the targets identified collectively by the company s geologists, geophysicists, and engineers. In an attempt to stay on a defined path, directional drillers often fail to properly compensate for variations in rotary walk and build, effective formation stresses, motor yields, hydrocarbon production potential, and tortuosity risks. There are, in fact, too many rapidly changing variables for the directional driller to consider and react to in real-time. Attempts to compensate for deviations from the plan have often lead to increased tortuosity of the final wellbore, missed reservoir, sidetracks, or unnecessary bit trips. The consequences of excess tortuosity include increased drilling times, increased stress on downhole equipment leading to tool failures, future problems in running completion hardware, an overall reduction in total recovered hydrocarbons, and future production problems such as unanticipated high water production or liquid hold-up in low spots along the lateral section of the wellbore. MOTIVE Drilling Technologies has addressed these problems with the MOTIVE Bit Guidance System, the industry s first use of cognitive computing to guide the directional drilling process which considers all costs to the asset and the economic consequences of directional drilling decisions. How does the MOTIVE Bit Guidance System differ from an experienced, high performing directional driller? The MOTIVE Directional Guidance System performs all of the standard directional drilling calculations that were previously done by the directional driller, but performs these calculations continuously and faster than is humanly possible. In addition, the system provides a tremendous amount of additional analysis of the data (such as cost consequences), and automatically makes the directional drilling steering decisions based on parameters set by the operator. The human directional driller does not have the capability to accurately consider all of the costs associated with increased tortuosity, potential lost hydrocarbon production, or to accurately determine the bit location in real-time. This automation of the analysis and decision-making process is only possible using advanced algorithms and high end computing. The guidance system removes the variable human element that leads to the large variation in performance in directional drilling seen today, and instead provides consistency of high performance somewhat independent of the experience level of the directional driller. The MOTIVE Bit Guidance System can be used to scale the expertise of a high performing directional driller, allowing him to guide the operations on multiple wells simultaneously. The Command Center tools have been designed for a single directional driller to be able to quickly review multiple operations and focus on the wells that need more attention. How does the MOTIVE Bit Guidance System improve communication between the rig and the office? The MOTIVE Bit Guidance System keeps the entire decision making team (on the rig and in the office) informed about past, current, and future planned directional drilling activities through its distributed 2D and 3D visualization interfaces, dynamic reporting, and automated email and text notifications. By providing complete directional drilling transparency to the entire team regardless of location, the system returns operational control back to the operator. Is the MOTIVE Bit Guidance System a Drilling Automation system? The short answer is that The Bit Guidance System is a partial automation system with a focus on automating much of the analysis, report generation, and decision-making related to Directional Drilling and Geosteering. Drilling Automation is not an all or nothing implementation. Sheridan and Verplanck have done a very good job of capturing different levels of automation from a fully human- based activity through to an activity where a computer makes and implements all decisions. Sheridan-Verplanck 10 levels of automation Human considers alternatives, makes and implements decision. Computer offers a set of alternatives which human may ignore in making decision. Computer offers a restricted set of alternatives, and human decides which to implement. Computer offers a restricted set of alternatives and suggests one, but human still makes and implements final decision. Computer offers a restricted set of alternatives and suggests one, which it will implement if human approve. Computer makes decision but gives human option to veto prior to implementation. Computer makes and implements decision, but must inform human after the fact. Computer makes and implements decision, and informs human only if asked to. Computer makes and implements decision, and informs human only if it feels this is warranted. Computer makes and implements decision if it feels it should, and informs human only if it feels this is warranted. The MOTIVE Bit Guidance System has advanced to level six automation. At this level, the Guidance System offers a restricted set of alternatives and suggests one, but a human driller still makes and implements final decision by operating the equipment on the rig floor. By automating the analysis and decision making tasks, the system has drastically improved directional drilling performance by reducing drilling time, reducing risk associated with tortuosity, and improving accuracy (leading to increased hydrocarbon potential). The MOTIVE Bit Guidance System could be used to set slide start and stop times and toolface orientation for mechanization tools that attempt to automatically set and hold the toolface at a user defined orientation. This integration would be a further move toward full automation. How do I access the MOTIVE Customer Portal? As a MOTIVE customer, you will be provided with your own private customer portal website dedicated to all of your wells that are drilled using the MOTIVE Bit Guidance System as well as any of your own historical or pilot well data used during Well and Geological Planning. Please contact Sales or Support for your Customer Portal website address. How do I stay informed on my directional drilling activities on the rig without having to continuously watch the MOTIVE 2D or 3D user interfaces? For each individual well, you can choose to be automatically notified either email or text message (SMS) for the following: trajectory surveys, sidetracks, anti-collision events, BHA changes, well plan changes, deviations from the well plan, geological plan changes, specific wellbore events, and formation detection events. Each notification can be turned on and off based on your preferences for a specific well. Can I install the MOTIVE iPad apps on my own device? Yes. If you are a current MOTIVE customer, you can submit a request to receive access for installing MOTIVE Bit Guidance apps on your iPad. Is the MOTIVE Bit Guidance System able to replace the Directional Driller? Interesting question . The MOTIVE Bit Guidance System was designed as a support tool for the directional driller. The Bit Guidance System does not perform any of the manual tasks currently performed by the directional driller such as preparing the tools in the BHA, nor does it implement the decisions on the rig floor (setting tool face, sliding, etc.). If other personnel on the rig are able to take on the manual directional drilling tasks, then the guidance system would allow a single directional driller to remotely advise operations on multiple rigs simultaneously. Since the Guidance System is deployed on the rig, it continues to operate and provide guidance to the driller even when communication may be lost between the command center and the rig. Knowledge of particular formation characteristics is also provided by experienced directional drillers. Until this knowledge is determined by the system or input into the system, the experience of local directional drillers is important. The system has been used to reduce the normal MWD/Directional Drilling four man crew on the rig down to a two man crew (one day shift and one night shift) with no change in performance. This is made possible since the system automates many of the tasks previously performed by the wellsite geologist, the MWD engineer, and the directional driller. MOTIVE provides a 24/7 Directional Drilling Command Center with experienced Directional Drillers monitoring and validating the decisions made by the Guidance System on the rig site. The directional drillers in the command center are often able to provide guidance based on local knowledge. With the Guidance System automatically performing all of the necessary calculations, a single directional driller can provide guidance to multiple wells simultaneously from a remote center. Without the system, the directional driller could not keep up with all of the calculations required for accurate, safe, and efficient directional drilling on multiple wells. What factors are considered by the MOTIVE Bit Guidance System? The system begins the decision-making guidance process by determining an error from the prescribed well path each time a survey is taken. The system then evaluates literally millions of possible options for adjusting the well path back to plan. Each path is evaluated, considering the costs that are associated with each path s predicted drilling time, risk due to predicted tortuosity, and ultimate hydrocarbon production potential. The cost analysis utilizes dynamically determined parameters such as geo-drift (rotary walk and build), motor yields, current position of the bit, and individual driller performance. Absolute rules are defined by the operator such as limits on dogleg severity, anti-collision, and distance to lease lines. Cost curves apply proportional penalties for these limits and to other factors such as distance from the pay zone, or deviation in trajectory, azimuth, or distance from plan. By setting parameters by region, the operator can ensure that the decisions being made on the rig site are in line with the drilling cost and production tradeoffs that the operator and asset manager see, rather than the individual directional driller s discretion. The results are higher production yields, higher consistency of execution, fewer tool failures, and enhanced overall economics. Thanks for learning about MOTIVE Drilling Technologies!

After dinner one night, she gets an Elemental Insights text alert to her mobile phone indicating that the temperature is rising in Freezer 12 in the Tissue Culture Lab, putting its irreplaceable tissue samples at risk. Lindsay finds a colleague working the night shift who makes sure the open door is shut, saving the inventory in the freezer. A malfunctioning freezer, or a freezer door carelessly left open, can imperil tens of thousands of dollars worth of inventory. Paul uses environmental data to increase yield Paul is the process manager for a biofuels manufacturer. His goal is to maximize process yield from his algae production. Yield depends upon a photosynthetic process, and as such, is highly dependent upon ambient conditions like temperature, humidity and light. Using an array of Element-A sensors, Paul is able to effortlessly record, store and retrieve vital environmental data and correlate it to process yields and quality and make improvements to optimize his process. He can even export this information to his quality management system using a standard API. Save time and money Linus is running a polymerization process and finding variations in his yield and product quality. Suspecting that relative humidity may be influencing his process, Linus checks the data from his Element-A sensors that monitor temperature and humidity. He is able to correlate relative humidity with a number of process changes. Armed with this new knowledge, Linus works with the facilities team to get humidity under control and increase his yields.
